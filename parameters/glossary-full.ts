It appears that despite our attempts to disable echoCancellation, noiseSuppression, and autoGainControl, the OS removes the calibration sounds, played through the loudspeaker, from the recording, which ruins the calibration. We were unabel to fix this, but we seem to get good recordings through a smartphone recruited through a QR code, so we're moving forward with that workaround. To use a calibrated mic (e.g. UMIK-1 from miniDSP) we attach it directly to the smartphone. We protect the scientist from bad calibration by disabling local connection by default.

    explanation:
      '🕑 _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool (default TRUE) saves the scientist time by calibrating the screen size (in cm) only once, and thereafter retrieving the size from a local cache. It enables EasyEyes saving and reading a "cookie" (in the participant computer browser\'s localStorage) containing the screen position (px), resolution (px), and size (cm), e.g. (0,0) px; 3024✕1964 px, and 24.5✕16 cm. The "cookie" is only read if _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool==TRUE. If read, the "cookie" is considered valid only if it reports a screen position (left, top) px and resolution (width ✕ height px) that match the current screen\'s position and resolution. \n\nIf calibrateScreenSizeBool==TRUE, and there\'s a valid cookie, then EasyEyes takes the screen size (width ✕ height cm) from the cookie instead of measuring it. (EasyEyes measures screen size by adjusting the size of a credit card drawing to match the size of a real credit card.) At the end of size calibration, if _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool==TRUE, then a "cookie" is saved, containing the screen position, resolution, and size. \n\nEasyEyes checks validity because it needs the size of the current screen, but the computer might have several screens, and the browser window could be opened on any of them. Similarly, the participant might replace a second screen. If the participant changes the screen resolution, then the "cookie" match will fail, and they\'ll have to recalibrate size. Similarly, localStorage is browser-specific, so if the participant switches browser, they\'ll have to recalibrate size. Those rare events represent only a minor inconvenience. This scheme is good because it is unlikely to mistake a new screen for an old one, and it uses one screen calibration to test many participants.\n\nLiterally, the credit card test measures pxPerCm, not size. We compute size (width and height in cm) from pxPerCm and the known resolution (width and height in px). Even so, screen size in cm is the more permanent property of the monitor because it is conserved when the participant uses an OS control panel to change to a new resolution with the same ratio of width to height. (If the new resolution has a different ratio of width to height, then the change in resolution will also slightly change the display area, i.e. size in cm.) ',

For example:\nhttps://www.minidsp.com/scripts/umikcal/umik90.php/7114754_90deg.txt\nThe microphone gain at frequency f_Hz is \ngain_dB(f_Hz) = _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB + SensFactor_dB + sensitivity_dB(f_Hz)\nwhere gain_dB is the level increase of digital power level out (dB) from sound level in (dB SPL), SensFactor_dB is read from the header of the microphone's calibration file, e.g. it's -1.198 dB in this header\n\"Sens Factor =-1.198dB, SERNO: 7114754\", \nand sensitivity_dB is read from the calibration file's table, which has one row per frequency.\n     _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB was determined for my two UMIK-1 microphones by using my 1 kHz 94 dB SPL Center 326 calibrator (which accepts any microphone tip diameter) and comparing with the free REW sound calibration app. The free REW app works with my two UMIK-1 mics and correctly reports my 1000 Hz 94 dB SPL Center 326 calibrator as 94 dB SPL (Z). So I worked out what value of _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB makes EasyEyes consistent with REW.

      '_calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB (default -100) is the base gain (dB power out re dB SPL power in) of a UMIK-2 microphone (miniDSP, Hong Kong). It is used solely to interpret the serial-number-indexed UMIK-2 calibration file available online from miniDSP. The microphone gain at frequency fHz is \ngain_dB = _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB + SensFactor_dB + sensitivity_dB(fHz)\nwhere gain_dB is the level increase of digital power level out (in dB) from sound level in (in dB SPL), SensFactor_dB is read from the header of the microphone\'s calibration file, e.g. it\'s -10.58 in this header\n"Sens Factor =-10.58dB, AGain =18dB, SERNO: 8104281"., and sensitivity_dB is read from the table, which has one row per frequency. EasyEyes ignores "AGain" (see note below).\n     _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB was determined by observing the free REW sound calibration app using my two UMIK-2 microphones recording my Reed R8090 Calibrator playing 1 kHz at 94 dB SPL. The free REW app works with my two UMIK-2 mics and correctly reports my 94±0.5 dB SPL Reed R8090 calibrator as either 93.7 or 94.2 dB SPL (Z). So I worked out what value of _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB makes EasyEyes consistent with REW. The value of _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB is approximately -100, which is consistent with a blog comment apparently by John Mulcahy, who seems to run REW. miniDSP speaks highly of Mulcahy and his REW software.\nhttps://www.hometheatershack.com/threads/understanding-spl-offset-umik-1.134857/post-1319361\nThat empirical approach succeeds, and replaces my earlier unsuccessful attempt to follow miniDSP\'s and REW\'s hard-to-read and apparently inconsistent documentation of what the "Sens Factor" means.\n     "AGain" NOTE: Supposedly the gain of the UMIK-2 can be changed (maybe by opening the mic and setting a switch or by softare, e.g. REW or Apple\'s "Audio MIDI Setup App"), and I suppose that "AGain=18dB" in the calibration file refers to that setting. However, I never changed the gain, and EasyEyes ignores the "AGain" parameter when reading the miniDSP UMIK-2 calibration file. "AGain" does not appear in the UMIK-1 calibration file.\n     NOTE: _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB=-124.8 is much less than _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB=-100.\n',

      '_needMemoryGB (default 8) requires that a participant computer running Windows or macOS have at least this many GB of memory, as reported by navigator.deviceMemory, but the requirement is halved for any other OS. We currently have memory-related issues only on Windows, so, if the browser, like Safari and Firefox, does not support navigator.deviceMemory, then we reject Windows, and accept any other OS. (When the Requiremenst page rejects a Windows computer because the browser doesn\'t support navigator.deviceMemory, the participant is invited to switch to Chrome or Edge, which do support it.)\n\n⚠ CAUTION: Setting _needMemoryGB>8 will reject all computers. That\'s because, to preserve privacy, the value returned by navigator.deviceMemory is rounded to the nearest discrete level: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8. Thus, for a MacBook Pro with 64 GB, it returns 8.\n\nnavigator.deviceMemory is supported by the browsers Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Samsung, but is not supported by Safari and Firefox.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/deviceMemory\n\nI asked ChatGPT to estimate the mean amounts of memory under several OSes: \n        •        Windows 10: Average 8 GB, with a wide range due to diverse user requirements.\n        •        macOS: Average 16 GB, following Apple’s recent standardization.\n        •        ChromeOS: Average 4 to 8 GB, reflecting the lightweight nature of Chromebooks.\n        •        Linux: Average 4 GB, considering the prevalence of mid-range systems.\nBased on results from 7 Windows computers, requiring 8 GB may achieve quick rendering of large fonts for Windows. macOS computers have been sold with at least 8GB for many years.

    explanation:
      "_needProcessorCoresMinimum (default 6) tries to exclude slow computers. The number of cores is a positive integer, also called \"hardwareConcurrency,\" whose value is returned by all modern browsers except Safari. When the API is not supported (i.e. on Safari), we estimate its value by doubling and rounding the rate (in MHz) at which the computer generates random numbers. That conversion is based on a correlation that we've observed between hardwareConcurrency and  computeRandomMHz. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor\n\nUPDATE. January 11, 2025. We just improved stimulus generation for acuity and crowding to pre-render the stimulus during the fixation task with opacity 0 and then show the target by merely setting its opacity to 1. This has greatly improved timing, i.e. targetMeasuredDurationSec and targetMeasuredLatenessSec. We also added a new parameter _needMemoryGB, which we recommend setting to 8. That will exclude Windows 10 computers that have only 4 GB. A quick test of timing with unconstrained cores shows that macOS produces bad latency and duration if it has only 2 or 4 cores. So, the default has been increased to 6.\n\nHISTORY. We were experiencing excess targetMeasuredDurationSec and targetMeasuredLatenessSec. We assumed that the excess time was a result of the computer being slow. After months of research, we conclude, instead, that the excess time is spent on heap allocation. Huge letters require allocating 100 or 200 MB of heap space for rendering, and heap allocation takes a time proportional to the allocation size, on the order of 100 ms for 100 MB. Furthermore, the amount of time needed to allocate that much heap space is strongly dependent on the amount of memory the computer has. Excluding Windows 10 computers with only 4 GB helps a lot.\n\nUsing Prolific, our experiments are occasionally invoked on slow computers that produce late and prolonged stimuli. EasyEyes measures lateness and duration and reports them as targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec in the CSV file. We find that setting _needProcessorCoresMinimum=6 nearly eliminated bad timing, but it also eliminates quite a few computers with good timing. You may prefer to set _needProcessorCoresMinimum lower, e.g. 4, to include most computers, and weed out the slow computers later, during data analysis, based on mean and SD of  targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec. \nNOTE: To make your computer harder to track, the Chrome extension DuckDuckGo spoofs the number of cores to 2. Any experiment requiring 3 or more cores will reject any participant whose computer spoofs having 2 cores. \nHIGH REJECTION RATE: As of January 2024, our experiments requiring 6 cores have good timing but their Requirements page rejects about as many participants as it accept. EasyEyes records the reason for rejection\n\nTO THE SCIENTIST RECRUITING ONLINE: After compiling your experiment, copy the requirements statement from the EasyEyes compiler page into your spreadsheet's _online2Description to inform online participants in advance of all study requirements.

As the experiment is compiled (into a newly created repository in Pavlovia bearing the experiment's name), the compiler will use the current value (default or assigned) of _pavlovia_Database_ResultsFormatBool to set the Results Format in the experiment's Pavlovia dashboard to either “CSV” or “Database”.\n\nTHIS WAS IMPLEMENTED TO WORK AROUND A TEMPORARY PROBLEM (March 26 to April 18, 2024) IN PAVLOVIA'S CSV RESULTS FORMAT: Pavlovia’s CSV results format was broken, so that in columns after \"targeTask\" (roughly the 37th), the headers are one row down and begin again from the first header. Pavlovia’s Database results format is fine. Since the problem was fixed on April 18, the default of _pavlovia_Database_ResultsFormatBool is FALSE.\n\nSPLITTING THE DATABASE FORMAT. The EasyEyes “Download results” button has been enhanced to download either kind of CSV file, as appropriate, and split any “Download”-style merged CSV into individual CSV files, practically equivalent to the CSV files that were returned by the “CSV”-mode when it worked properly.\n\nMANUAL OVERRIDE. We can't think of a reason to do so, but the scientist can use the manual control in the Pavlovia dashboard to change the experiment's results format, overriding whatever was selected in the experiment spreadsheet.\n\nNOTE: To download a cursor file (_saveCursorPositionBool=TRUE), Pavlovia must use the CSV results format (_pavlovia_Database_ResultsFormatBool=FALSE, the default). Otherwise the cursor data file will not appear. At some point we'll enhance the compiler to raise an error when both are true.",

    explanation:
      "_pavloviaNewExperimentBool (default TRUE) can be set to FALSE to reuse the current Pavlovia repository. This is helpful when it's important to retain the same Pavlovia URL for your experiment, because another experiment links to it. It's also helpful for users without an institutional Pavlovia license, because assignment of credits in Pavlovia is specific to the repository, so it's more convenient to keep using the same repository.\n\nWithout an institutional license, Pavlovia requires assigning credit (money) to each experiment before it can run in RUNNING mode. (PILOTING mode is free, but only accessible manually within Pavlovia.) \n\nIf _pavloviaNewExperimentBool=TRUE (the default), then, when EasyEyes compiles your experiment, EasyEyes appends the smallest possible integer (at least 1) to the spreadsheet filename (without extension) to create a unique (unused) experiment name. That keeps versions apart, and keeps the data from each version in its own repository. \n     Setting _pavloviaNewExperimentBool=FALSE will reuse the old repo, instead of creating a new repo every time you compile. The downside is that if you collect data, edit the experiment, and collect more data, the data files will all be together in the same repo, distinguished only by date.\n     When _pavloviaNewExperimentBool=FALSE, scientists without an institutional license only need to assign credit the first time they compile (when it's a new repo). Once it has credits, they can keep testing, through countless compiles, without visiting Pavlovia, until the experiment runs out of credits. \n     This flag doesn't affect PILOTING mode, which is always free and can only be used from within Pavlovia. \n     Also, any users concerned over the huge proliferation of repos might like to set _pavloviaNewExperimentBool=FALSE to minimize the number of repos created by EasyEyes.\n\nSee _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool for a more advice on working without an institutional Pavlovia site license.",

    availability: "now",
    example: "FALSE",
    explanation:
      "_pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool helps EasyEyes optimize its behavior by indicating your preference for use of RUNNING or PILOTING mode while testing. Pavlovia offers two modes (RUNNING and PILOTING) for running your study. Remote data collection requires RUNNING mode. PILOTING mode is meant for checking and debugging and runs only from the Pavlovia console on the scientist's computer. The only advantage of the PILOTING mode is that it's always free. Unless your institution has a Pavlovia site license, RUNNING mode costs 22 pence per participant (in 2024), and requires assigning credits (money) in advance to each experiment. (Setting _pavloviaNewExperiment=FALSE allows you to request that EasyEyes keep reusing the same experiment name, as you compile new versions, so you can assign credits once to the experiment, when you begin testing, instead of before each compile.) Thus scientists with a site license will always prefer RUNNING mode. Without that license, scientists can save money by using PILOTING mode during development, and switch to RUNNING mode to test remote participants. The parameter _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool allows you to express your preference. With an institutional site license, you'll always want the default TRUE. Without an institutional site license, you can save money by setting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool=FALSE during development, and TRUE for the actual remote testing. Without a site license, if you don't mind the 22 p expense, you can use RUNNING mode throughout (use the default _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool=TRUE), and set _compileAsNewExperiment=FALSE to minimize the frequency at which you must assign credits to the experiment.\n\nOLD EXPLANATION. Setting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool TRUE (the default) streamlines the use of Pavlovia's RUNNING mode, and setting it FALSE streamlines the use of Pavlovia's PILOTING mode. _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool helps EasyEyes anticipate your preference in optimizing the EasyEyes user interface. EasyEyes uses a Pavlovia repository to hold your experiment. Pavlovia offers two modes for running your experiment, PILOTING and RUNNING. PILOTING mode is free, but can only be run directly from the Pavlovia dashboard, which prevents remote testing. RUNNING mode costs 20 pence per participant (this fee is waived if your instititution has a site license), and you get a URL for your study that you can send to your online participants. It is our guess that most EasyEyes users (like current Pavlovia users) will belong to institutions with Pavlovia site licenses, and thus have no usage fee. Thus, for most users, we suggest letting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool be TRUE (the default) to streamline the EasyEyes scientist page for RUNNING mode. When _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool is TRUE, you just submit your table to the EasyEyes compiler to receive your study URL, with no more clicks. That includes setting your experiment to RUNNING mode in Pavlovia. If _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool is FALSE, then your experiment remains in the INACTIVE mode, waiting for you to click the \"Go to Pavlovia\" button, where you'll use the Pavlovia dashboard to set your experiment to PILOTING mode and run it. (Pavlovia has no API by which EasyEyes could do this for you.) If your experiment is already in RUNNING mode you can still switch to PILOTING mode. ",

In Workspace mode you assign funds to a folder which has a name and a project ID (a roughly 24-digit hexadecimal number). You can have multiple studies in one project folder; they all share the same project ID. If your experiment table includes an _prolific1ProjectID number, then EasyEyes will use it and call Prolific in Workspace mode. If _prolific1ProjectID is empty or absent, then EasyEyes will call Prolific in pre-Workspace mode.  If you provide a wrong Project ID then you'll get an invalid address (404) when EasyEyes tries to access your Prolific workspace. EasyEyes assumes that Prolific is locked into one mode or the other. (In fact, Prolific allows you to upgrade your Prolific account from pre-Workspace into Workspace mode, but you cannot downgrade, which is fine since Workspace mode is better.) If EasyEyes calls Prolific in the wrong mode, the call fails to transfer vital information for your study, which you'll notice when you try to publish your study in Prolific. Currently EasyEyes can't tell which mode your Prolific account is in, and expects you to provide a _prolific1ProjectID if and only if Prolific is in Workspace mode. So if you arrive in Prolific, and find Prolific ignorant of your study, you probably guessed wrong about the mode of your Prolific account. Does your study in Prolific have a Prolific Project ID? If yes, then your Prolific account is in Workspace mode, otherwise not. You can run all studies with the same _prolific1ProjectID, or have several projects eash with their own _prolific1ProjectID.",

    explanation:
      '❌ _saveEachBlockBool works, but isn\'t recommended. Use _logFontsBool instead. \nWhen _saveEachBlockBool=TRUE (default is FALSE), the experiment will save to CSV as it begins each block. Thus, even if the participant abruptly quits or the computer freezes, the CSV file will always include the last active block. Usually _saveEachBlockBool will be FALSE because, unless absolutely necessary, we don’t want to use the internet in the middle of the session (to minimize delay and make the experiment more robust). But scientists will enable it when they want to know which block failed. \nSAVING. The extra saves enabled by _saveEachBlockBool are in addition to the always-performed saves at the beginning and "end" of the session. ("End" includes a shift of attention aways from the EasyEyes page, which is not the end if the participant returns.) All saves are alike in saving all currently known rows and parameters to the CSV file, and all saves are cumulative, only adding new data. The CSV file on Pavlovia is readable throughout, and grows in length with successive saves. EasyEyes first saves after the Requirements check, before the remote calibration (regardless of whether the remote calibrator runs), which is before the first block, and again at the "end," which includes four cases: 1. completion, 2. orderly termination through an error message or the escape mechanism including waiting out the "saving" window at the end, 3. closing the EasyEyes window before completion or termination, and 4. shift of browser focus away from the EasyEyes page before completion or termination. Saving does not end the experiment.  After shifting attention away, the participant can shift attention back to EasyEyes and continue the experiment, which will save again in any of the four ways. This can happen again and again. \nCAUTION: We introduced this in order to track down what happened to participants that are logged by Prolific and not Pavlovia. It helped, but some participants still escaped detection by Pavlovia. Also, we have the impression that enabling _saveEachBlockBool increased the probability of EasyEyes failing. So we introduced a new method, _logParticipantsBool, which is better. It seems not to cause failure and is more successful in detecting the participants who were undetected by Pavlovia. _logParticipantsBool saves a bit of data about the participant in a FormSpree server.  The data remains on that server and is automatically aggregated by Shiny when it analyzes the Pavlovia results. Shiny also aggregates the Proflific report if its included in the *.results.zip file of Pavlovia results. Our current advice is to enable _logParticipantsBool only if you\'re worried about Pavlovia failing to record participants that are logged by Prolific. ',

If no device, then we skip the rest of the calibrations that need a measuring device. In our instructions, we can say "Use your ruler, stick, or tape to measure this." When receiving fractional inches we could either accept a string like "16 3/16" or we could have three fields that each accept an integer, and allow the user to tab from field to field: "?? ??/??".

We can display a huge double headed arrow from left edge to right edge. After measuring viewing distance we can ask them to use ruler, stick, or tape to create three exact viewing distances that we then use the webcam to measure.

Set the new CSV output parameter calibrationRulerBool (default empty) to TRUE or FALSE indicating whether a suitable measuring device is available. If FALSE, then EasyEyes will skip all tests that require a measuring device. In our instructions, we can say "Use your ruler, stick, or tape to measure this." When receiving fractional inches we could either accept a string like "16 3/16" or we could have three fields that each accept an integer, and allow the user to tab from field to field: "?? ??/??". The last number must be 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. For round numbers, the numerator will be zero. After measuring screen size, we can ask them to use their ruler, stick, or tape to measure screen width. We can display a huge double headed arrow from left edge to right edge. After measuring viewing distance we can ask them to use ruler, stick, or tape to create three exact viewing distances that we then use the webcam to measure. We can request 12, 24, or 36 inches, or 30, 60, or 90 cm. (These are round numbers, not exactly equivalent.) \n     We have two ways of measuring viewing distance and I’d like to evaluate both. Our current scheme with the calibrator is to have a Boolean parameter for each calibration. We should have separate parameters for the two methods of measuring viewing distance so scientists can select none, either, or both. It would be interesting to compare the two estimates (direct vs indirect) of pupillary distance. We should always save the pupillary distance with the data. We can compare our population distribution with the textbook distribution. It might be an elegant check on our biometrics. \n     We could test people online and mention in our job description that they must have a tape measure, meter stick, or yard stick.

In ordinary browsing, it\'s helpful that browsers freely substitute fonts so that you almost always get something readable in the web page you\'re reading.

For example, many fonts are served for free by the Google Fonts server.  https://fonts.google.com/  At that website, use "Search for font". Having found your font, select the style you want. In the "Selected Family" pop-up window, click the "@import" button. From within the revealed CSS code, copy the URL from inside the "url(. )". \n\nEasyEyes preloads all fonts. At the beginning of the experimen, EasyEyes preloads all needed fonts, for the whole experiment (all conditions), so, after preload, the experiment runs with no font-loading delay and no need for internet, except to save data at the end.\n\nLICENSING. Fonts are intellectual property, and you normally need a license to use them. Buying a font for "desktop" use typically gets you an OTF or TTF font file and a license for desktop use. Buying for "web" use typically gets you WOFF and WOFF2 font files and a license for web use. Using a font with EasyEyes is web use. If you don\'t have a WOFF or WOFF2 file, an OTF or TTF file will work, but beware of the possibility that you may not have a license to use it on the web. Most font designer struggle to make a living. We should pay the license fees to use their fonts.\n\nZAPFINO. EasyEyes works well with all but one of the many fonts we\'ve tried. The exception is Zapfino. Zapfino text is always left of where it should be by 14% of the nominal font size. The error is surprising. We don\'t have a theory to explain it. We implemented fontPixiMetricsString to fix this, but it has no effect. [Note that Zapfino requires fontPadding of at least 0.5.] ',

We added fontMaxPx to avoid crashes and blackouts that result from trying to draw or measure huge characters. (The crash might be in the font itself, or PIXI.js, or PsychoJS.) The crash can be "out of memory". "Blackouts" is a solid black screen while trying to draw text (e.g. the crowding triplet). 950 is a rough estimate of the threshold for trouble, but it depends on the font. For a particular font, you may be able to set fontMaxPx higher. If you enable FormSpree logging (set _logFontBool=TRUE), then, after an online crash, the Sessions page in Analyze will report the font and size immediately before the crash. \n\npx vs pt.

Over several trials, successive reductions will eventually find a safe text size. Bad text rendering occurs when rendering very large letters and is resolved by reducing fontMaxPx. The largest safe size depends on the font, the character string, the computer’s rendering speed, and the amount of heap space provided by the browser to the EasyEyes web app. fontMaxPxShrinkage must be a positive fraction between zero and 1. A value of 1 risks redoing the same bad trial again and again until all allocated trials are wasted. The number of allocated trials is conditionTrials + conditionTrials*thresholdRepeatedReRequestedTrials.\n\nThe default fontMaxPx value is chosen to be safe for most fonts and computers. When EasyEyes detects a bad text stimulus, it sets fontMaxPx to the product of fontMaxPxShrinkage and the nominal font size (in px) of the failed stimulus. Since the current font size is always less than or equal to fontMaxPx, reductions are cumulative, progressively shrinking fontMaxPx as needed. \n\nWhen the text stimulus was bad, EasyEyes does not pass the trial to Quest. However, without input, Quest would suggest the same stimulus strength on the next trial, which would likely fail again. This could waste the remaining trials in the block by repeatedly presenting oversized stimuli. By successively reducing fontMaxPx after each failure, fontMaxPxShrinkage ensures that, over several trials, the condition converges on a safe size.\n\nAlso see fontMaxPx, fontMaxPxShrinkage, fontDetectBlackoutBool, \nthresholdAllowedLatenessSec, thresholdAllowedDurationRatio, thresholdAllowedReplacementReRequestedTrials, and conditionTrials.",

This has the intended effect with Arabic, and has no effect in the Roman alphabet. Still untested with other alphabets, e.g. Persian. In Arabic, ligatures respond to the neighboring letters. To test crowding we set thresholdParameter=spacingDeg and targetKind=letter. When we identify crowded Arabic letters in typographic mode, the target character is displayed in medial shape (i.e. connected) as a stimulus. If fontMedialShapeResponseBool is TRUE (the default) then the response screen also shows each response letter in its medial shape. If FALSE, then the response letter is shown in its isolated shape (i.e. disconnected). Having the target letter change shape between stimulus and response screens may make it harder to identify, especially by less fluent readers. To achieve this, when fontMedialShapeResponseBool is TRUE we precede the response character by a Tarweel joiner character (U+0640) and follow it by a zero-width joiner (ZWJ) character (U+200D).

CLIPPING. Find the smallest value of fontPadding that renders all your font’s characters without clipping. More lacy fonts with long flourishes need more fontPadding to avoid clipping. For each of 23 fonts here is the minimum value of fontPadding for no clipping (Maria Pombo, September, 2024).\nFont        Foundry        fontPadding\nAgoesa        Megatype        0\nArial Regular        Monotype        0\nExtenda 10 Pica        Zetafonts        0\nFrutiger Pro 55 Roman        Linotype        0\nHaut Relief        Nick's Fonts        0\nLetraflex Regular        Art Grootfontein        0\nMuseo Sans 500        exljbris Font Foundry        0\nTiny 5x3 100        Velvetyne        0\nBaskerville Pro Regular        Paratype        0.1\nCourier Prime        Google        0.1\nGeorgia Regular        Microsoft        0.1\nLiebeLotte        LiebeFonts        0.1\nOMFUG        Catkie        0.1\nProxima Nova        Mark Simonson Studio        0.1\nSabon Next Pro Regular        Linotype        0.1\nScarlet Wood Bold        supertype        0.1\nThe Sans Plain        LucasFonts        0.1\nTimes New Roman        Monotype        0.1\nAdobe Caslon Regular        Adobe        0.2\nLe Monde Livre Std Regular        Typofonderie        0.2\nRollerscript Smooth        G-Type        0.2\nEdwardian Script ITC Pro Regular        ITC        0.4\nPelli        denis.pelli@nyu.edu        0.5\nZapfino Extra Pro Regular        Linotype        0.5\nRed indicates that the font require more than the default (0.2) fontPadding to render without clipping.\n\n2. TIMEOUTS. By \"timeout\", we mean excess target lateness or a duration that is unacceptably short or long, relative to the requested targetDurationSec. The scientist sets timeout limits by assigning values to thresholdAllowedDurationRatio (default 1.5) and thresholdAllowedLatenessSec (default 0.1). A trial that exceeds any of these bounds is recorded in the CSV results file, but is not passed on to QUEST, so it doesn't contribute to the threshold estimate. Ideally EasyEyes would schedule a replacement trial, but PsychoJS doesn't yet support that (though PsychoPy does). You may have to reduce fontPadding, accepting some clipping, to minimize the loss of trials on slower computers. If possible, switch to a faster font, i.e. one that times out less. For a value of 0.5 of a lacy font, 62% of Prolific participants had no timeouts, 31% had timeouts in less than 10% of the trials, and the remaining 7% of participant lost most trials due to timeouts. Most timeouts were caused by a high targetMeasuredLatenessSec. Slower computer tolerate less fontPadding of large lacy fonts.\n\n3. ASSESSMENT. For your chosen font and fontPadding, at the largest size you need, assess timeouts by plotting histograms of targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec from the CSV results file. (Press \"Download results\" button on the EasyEyes compiler page.) To analyze crashes use _logFontBool, which saves the details of every font rendering, so you can examine the last one before the crash. (Use EasyEyes > Analyze to examine crash results.) The maximum safe value of fontPadding will be lower for slower computers, which are common online. Use thresholdAllowedDurationRatio and thresholdAllowedLatenessSec to specify what's acceptable.",

"wght" is weight, which allows you to select any weight from extra thin, to regular, to bold, to black. "wdth" is width, which allows you to select any width from compressed to regular to expanded. (We\'re not sure, but we anticipate no error and no effect of using an unsupported axis name.) All modern browsers support variable fonts. Internet Explorer does not.\n\nYOUR FONT\'S AXES. To discover your variable font\'s axes of variation, and their allowed ranges, try this web page: https://fontgauntlet.com/. Or assign your font to some text in Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator\'s Character pane (in the Properties window) has a tiny variable-font icon consisting of a narrow and a wide T above a slider. Clicking that icon pops up a panel with a slider for each of your font\'s variable axes. Adobe\'s Roboto Flex variable font has 11 axes.\n\nFURTHER READING\nhttps://abcdinamo.com/news/using-variable-fonts-on-the-web \nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-variation-settings\n',

Here are some results using tiltedFlickeringGrating.js on Chrome on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020), asking ffMPEG to use the avc1 : libx264 codec. Total prep time (watching the wait icon) grows linearly with the product of pixels per frame and number of frames. \ntimeSec = 1 + MPix*frames/4\nwhere timeSec is the prep time in seconds, MPix means a mega pixel, i.e. one million pixels, and frames is the number of frames in the movie. 25% of this is the runtime of the tiltedFlickeringGrating.js, and 75% is ffMPEG. The formula for just ffMPEG is\nffMpegSec = 0.7 + MPix*frames/6\nThe 6 MPix/s rate seems fine. The fixed 0.7 s overhead is surprising.

EasyEyes provides the width*height*2 array xyDeg[i,j,k], where each 2-number element (indexed by k) is the x,y position in deg of pixel i,j. Use of the xyDeg array does not allow speed up by computational separation of x and y, so you may prefer to use the separable approximation provided by the width-long vector xDeg and height-long vector yDeg, which provide approximate visual coordinates of the pixels in movieRectPx. (Note: xyDeg takes time and space for EasyEyes to compute, and not all movieComputeJS programs need it, so EasyEyes skips making xyDeg if the string  "xyDeg" is not found in the movieComputeJS file.)\n\nEXAMPLE: movieComputeJS might contain the filename "VerticalGrating.js", and that file might contain:\n// Compute vertical Gabor.\nvar imageNit = new Array(xDeg.length).fill(0)\n        .map(() => new Array(yDeg.length).fill(0));\nvar gx = [];\nvar gy = [];\nfor (const x of xDeg) {\n        gx.push(\n                Math.exp(-((x-targetEccentrictyXDeg)/targetSpaceConstantDeg)**2)\n        );\n}\nfor (const y of yDeg) {\n        gy.push(\n                Math.exp(-((y-targetEccentrictyYDeg)/targetSpaceConstantDeg)**2)\n        );\n}\nvar fx = [];\nfor (i = 0; i < xDeg.length; i++) {\n        fx[i]=gx[i]*Math.sin(\n                2*Math.PI*((xDeg[i]-targetEccentrictyXDeg)*targetCyclePerDeg + targetPhase/360)\n        )\n}\nfor (j = 0; j < yDeg.length; j++) {\n        for (i = 0; i < xDeg.length; i++) {\n                imageNit[i][j] = (255/2) * (1 + targetContrast * gy[j] * fx[i]);\n        }\n}',

It consists of four float numbers separated by commas, stored as text. All number are in deg relative to fixation. deg are positive above and to the right of fixation. The sequence is left,bottom,right,top. Whatever is requested will be mapped to pixels and clipped by screenRectPx. \n     Note that movieRectDeg is a rect on the retina, which will be curved on the screen, and tthe movie's screen pixels are specified as the screen rect, movieRectDeg. Guided by movieRectPxContainsRectDegBool, EasyEyes creates screenRectPx to be a reasonable approximation to movieRectDeg.\n     The scientist provides movieRectDeg, which defines a rect in visual coordinates (i.e. deg on the retina). Note that straight lines in visual space generally correspond to curves in pixel space. However, the HDR movie must be a screen rect (horizontal & vertical rectangle), so EasyEyes defines the movieRectPx screen rect approximation to movieRectDeg. movieRectDeg is rectangular on the retina, and movieRectPx is rectangular on the screen. \n     movieRectPx is the screen rect used for the movie. It is derived from movieRectDeg according to movieRectPxContainsDegBool, and then clipped by screenRectPx. If movieRectDeg is empty (the default) then movieRectPx is the whole screen, ie screenRectPx.\n     The movie bounds are movieRectPx. To compute a movie, we usually need to know the visual coordinate of each pixel. If needed, EasyEyes provides the 2*width*height array xyDeg, where array xyDeg(i,j) is the x,y position in deg of pixel (i,j).",

The issue, of course, is that a rect on the screen (px coordinates) when mapped to the retina (deg coordinates) is not a rect, all four sides are curved. Similarly, a rect on the retina (deg coordinates) when mapped to the screen (px coordinates) is not a rect, all four sides are curved.

This is used in two way, first, in the Requirements page, to reject a computer screen that doen't have enough pixels, and second, at the beginning of each block to reduce viewing distance, if necessary, to provide the requested angular screen width.\n\n1. REQUIRE SCREEN PIX ON REQUIREMENTS PAGE. EasyEyes computes the required screen resolution enforced by the Requirements page. For each block, needScreenWidthDeg, needScreenHeightDeg, needTargetSizeDownToDeg, and targetMinimumPx are combined to compute minimum screen-width px and screen-height pix. The max  of each across blocks is enforced in the Requirements page. Note that needTargetSizeDownToDeg is used solely for this resolution requirement, so you can eliminate this requirement by setting needTargetSizeDownToDeg to a large value, e.g. 10.\n     EasyEyes ignores any conditions disabled by setting conditionEnabledBool=FALSE. Similarly EasyEyes ignores any block disabled by virtue of having all its conditions disabled. \n     EasyEyes uses, from the experiment spreadsheet, one logical parameter conditionEnabledBool and four numerical parameters: targetMinimumPx, needTargetSizeDownToDeg, needScreenWidthDeg, and needScreenHeightDeg. For each block, EasyEyes first computes max of the required pixel density (px/deg) across enabled conditions:\nminPxPerDeg = max(targetMinimumPx/needTargetSizeDownToDeg) \nacross enabled conditions in the block. Then it computes max of the required screen subtense (deg) across enabled conditions in each block:\nminScreenHeightDeg=max(needScreenHeightDeg)\nand\nminScreenWidthDeg=max(needScreenWidthDeg)\nFrom these three variables, minPxPerDeg, minScreenHeightDeg, minScreenWidthDeg, EasyEyes computes the min screen resolution (px), for each block:\nminScreenWidthPx=minPxPerDeg*tand(minScreenWidthDeg/2)/tand(1/2)\nminScreenHeightPx=minPxPerDeg*tand(minScreenHeightDeg/2)/tand(1/2)\nwhere tand is a tangent function that accepts an angle in deg, i.e. tand(x) = tan(x*pi/180).\nThe required resolution for the experiment is the max required resolution max(minScreenWidthPx) and max(minScreenHeightPx) across all enabled blocks. These requirements are declared and enforced on the Requirements page, which rejects any computer screen with insufficient resolution.\n\n2. ADJUST VIEWING DISTANCE OF EACH BLOCK. The EasyEyes compiler requires viewingDistanceDesiredCm to be the same across conditions in a block, but allows it to differ across blocks. needScreenWidthDeg is used, at the beginning of each block, to reduce viewing distance below viewingDistanceDesiredCm, if necessary, so that the screen will have at least the requested width in deg. Default is zero, which is ignored. \nmaxViewingDistanceCm = screenWidthCm/(2*tand(needScreenWidthDeg/2)),\nwhere tand is a tangent function that accepts an angle in deg, i.e. tand(x) = tan(x*pi/180).\nSet the block's viewing distance to min(maxViewingDistanceCm, viewingDistanceDesiredCm).\n\n3. PRACTICAL ADVICE. Modern displays have a lot of pixels, so you might be tempted to do all your testing at one viewing distance. However, no display on the market has enough pixels for you to use the same viewing distance to measure foveal acuity (with needTargetSizeDownToDeg=0.03) and peripheral crowding (with needScreenWidthDeg=30). The solution is to use a block with long viewing distance to measure foveal acuity (needTargetSizeDownToDeg=0.03), and another block, with short viewing distance, to measure peripheral vision (with needScreenWidthDeg=30).\n\n3.

Each bar is black or white, indicating the presence or absence of a specified element: Gap, Fixation, Target request, or Target. Each bar is 2 inches wide and 1.25 inches high, with static text labels ("Gap", "Fixation", "Target request", "Target") to the right of each box, describing its purpose. The bars and labels overwrite whatever was there before. The bars update dynamically based on the following conditions:\n(Gap): Turns white at end of the fixation task (before markingOffsetToTargetOnsetSec) and black when the target appears.\n(Fixation): Turns white when the crosshair is present, regardless of its motion, and black when the crosshair is absent.\n(Target request): Turns white when the target is requested (after markingOffsetToTargetOnsetSec) and stays on until target offset. Lateness can be measured by the onset asynchrony between this request bar and the target bar.\n(Target): Turns white when the target is present and black when the target is absent.\n\nThese bars are designed be detected by the photocells of the BBTK to measure stimulus timing. \n\nTo check display timing, the gold standard is the Black Box Toolkit (BBTK). \nhttps://www.blackboxtoolkit.com/  \nMaria has one, and has figured out how to use it. It includes two (fast) photosensors that can be placed on the display, held in place by elastic cords. The Black Box Toolkit has its own clock and accepts many kinds of input, including sound and the two photocells. The bars displayed by showTimingBarsBool match the size of the photosensors. \n\nWith the Black Box Toolkit we can measure latency and duration with 1 ms accuracy. It\'s hard for the computer generating the display to know exactly when each frame is displayed, so the computer can only estimate the actual timing of the displayed stimulus.

When thresholdParameter is "spacingDeg", spacingRelationToSize specifies how target size depend on center-to-center target-flanker spacing. And when thresholdParameter is "targetSizeDeg", spacingRelationToSize specifies how spacing depend on size.\n• none means no dependence. Size and spacing are set independently. \n• ratio means accept the thresholdParameter (which is either spacingDeg or targetSizeDeg) and adjust the other one to satisfy the specified spacingOverSizeRatio. There are two flankers, inner and outer. In general each has a different (center to center) spacing to the target. "ratio" refers to the ratio of spacing to target size. Set spacingIsOuterBool to choose whether size scales with inner (FALSE) or outer (TRUE) spacing.\n• typographic prints the triplet (flanker, target, flanker) as a (horizontal) string (horizontally) centered on the specified target eccentricity. By "horizontal" and "vertical", we just mean the orientation of the baseline, and orthogonal to it. ("Vertically," the fontCharacterSet bounding box is centered on the eccentric location, and all letters in the string are on same baseline.) If thresholdParameter is "spacingDeg" then the font size of string is adjusted so that the width of the string is 3× the specified spacing. Works with both left-to-right and right-to-left fonts. [If thresholdParameter is "targetSizeDeg" then EasyEyes adjusts the font size of the string to achieve the specified target size.] \n\nTYPOGRAPHIC. Rule for positioning the stimulus string (one acuity letter or three crowding letters) in typographic mode.\nHORIZONTALLY. It’s a string and EasyEyes doesn’t know where one letter ends and the next begins. At the beginning of the trial, before the fixation task, set font size to fontReferenceSizePx (i.e. convert px to pt, and use that to set font size), and ask PIXI for our string\'s "width" in px. Width is the (horizontal) displacement from initial to final pen position when the string is drawn. For generality, divide it by fontReferenceSizePx,  \nwidthPxReFontSize = width / fontReferenceSizePx\nLooking ahead, we will take the horizontal midpoint of the string to be halfway between the start and end pen positions. \nVERTICALLY. In the spirit of good typography, we believe that the vertical position of the text baseline should be independent of the particular letters being displayed. To achieve that, the vertical positioning of the target string is based on the whole alphabet in use, which is conserved from trial to trial. At the beginning of the block, EasyEyes sets the font size to fontReferenceSizePx and measures a true bounding box for the fontCharacterSet string. Retain only topPx and bottomPx. For generality, subtract initial pen y position and normalize by fontReferenceSizePx. This gives us \ntopPxReFontSize = (topPx-penY)/fontReferenceSizePx\nand\nbottomPxReFontSize = (bottomPx-penY)/fontReferenceSizePx\nWe will need it later, so also use the code below to get "ascent" from PIXI, and compute\nascentPxReFontSize = ascent / fontReferenceSizePx.\n\nNow create\nboundsRectReFontSize=\n  [[0,bottomPxReFontSize], [widthPxReFontSize,topPxReFontSize]]\nBefore drawing the target, EasyEyes scales the rect up to the actual font size, \nboundsRect=fontSIzePx*boundsRectReFontSize\nand computes a new rect like boundsRect, but centered on the target eccentricity.\ncenteredRect=boundsRect - CenterOfRect(boundsRect) + targetEccentricityXYPx\nIf showBoundingBoxBool==TRUE then draw centeredRect with a blue line. \nCompute the pen position, typically a bit above the upper left corner of our rect.\npenX = centeredRect[0,0] - boundsRect[0,0];\npenY = centeredRect[1,1] - boundsRect[1,1];\nand draw the text there. It should fit the bounding box quite well. [Vertically our bounds allow for any character in fontCharacterSet, and horizontally, our bounding box considers only the pen positions, ignoring any long horizontal flourishes.]\nIf showBoundingBoxBool==TRUE also draw a horizontal green line representing the baseline, from end of end of our bounding box, at height baselinePx\nbaselinePx = penY - fontSIzePx*ascentPxReFontSize\n\nEXPLAINING THE BASELINE \nIn digital typography, the "pen position" at start and end of drawing a string is traditionally on the baseline. This is true of HTML Canvas, but currently EasyEyes is built on PsychoJS which renders text using PIXI.js which considers the pen position to be the upper left corner of the "bounding box" around the string. (I think the vertical extent of their "bounding box" is sized to hold any characters, not the just the ones in your string.) In PIXI, the baseline is "ascender" px below the pen position. Here is javascript code from ChatGTP to get the value of ascender from PIXI.\n\n// 1. Create text style\nconst textStyle = new PIXI.TextStyle({\n  fontFamily: \'Arial\',\n  fontSize: 24,\n  fill: \'black\',\n});\n\n// 2. Create text object\nconst textObj = new PIXI.Text(\'Hello World\', textStyle);\ntextObj.x = 100; // Pen position x\ntextObj.y = 50;  // Pen position y (top-left corner)\n\n// 3. Measure text\nconst metrics = PIXI.TextMetrics.measureText(textObj.text, textObj.style);\n\n// 4. Get ascent (vertical offset to baseline)\nconst ascent = metrics.fontProperties.ascent;\n\n// 5. Calculate baseline position\nconst baselineY = textObj.y + ascent;\n\n// 6. Output the results\nconsole.log(\'Pen Position (Top-Left Corner):\', textObj.x, textObj.y);\nconsole.log(\'Vertical Offset to Baseline (Ascent):\', ascent);\nconsole.log(\'Baseline Position Y:\', baselineY);',

(JPG is just an abbreviation of the JPEG extension; JP2 indicates JPEG 2000.) On each trial, the target image is sampled randomly, without replacement, from the images in the image folder. (\"Without replacement\" considers all the trials of this condition of this block. Other conditions and blocks are independent.) The folder is submitted as a zip archive to the EasyEyes drop box, and saved in the EasyEyesResources repository of the scientist's Pavlovia account. To be clear: The scientist creates a suitably named folder full of images, and zips that; the zip archive inherits the name of the folder. Each file in the folder must have one of the allowed image-file extensions. Different files can have different extensions. No subfolders are allowed. An experiment uses the folder by setting targetImageFolder to the name of the zip archive, without the extension.\n\nEach image with embedded icc color profile will be color managed. 10-bit rendering and HDR are automatic, but require use of 16-bit png or jpeg2000. Parameters allow the scientist to specify eccentricity, size, and duration. When the images have diverse size the scientist can instead specify image pixels per degree. \nCOLOR MANAGEMENT. The browser's color-managed rendering will take into account the ICC color profiles of the image and display. For accurate image rendering, each image should have an embedded ICC color profile. (The informal convention of assuming an sRGB profile when none is embedded seems too unreliable, across browsers, for research-grade stimuli.) \n\nHDR. A large proportion of computer displays produced in recent years support 10 bits per color channel, and most browsers now use the 10 bits when displaying HDR (High dynamic range) images using the HTML <img> tag. Several Netflix engineers studied how to achieve 10-bit display on current browsers using available image formats. \nhttps://netflixtechblog.com/enhancing-the-netflix-ui-experience-with-hdr-1e7506ad3e8\nThey recommend using 16-bit PNG or JPEG 2000. 16-bit PNG is supported by the several browsers we tested. As of September 2022, Safari was the only browser supporting JPEG 2000.\nhttps://caniuse.com/jpeg2000\nSurprisingly, another web page claims that JPEG2000 is also supported by Chrome and Firefox.\nhttps://fileinfo.com/extension/jp2\n\n[FUTURE: Instead of the zip archive, we could also allow our submit box to accept a folder, which it copies, including all the directly enclosed files.]",

    explanation:
      '⭑ targetKind (default letter) specifies the kind of target.\n• letter On each trial, the target is a randomly selected character from the fontCharacterSet displayed in the specified font.\n• repeatedLetter. Display many copies of two targets, alternating across the screen. The observer reports both. Thus each presentation gets two responses, which count as two trials. The two target letters alternate for as many lines as fit on the screen and within targetRepeatsMaxLines. The last character at both ends of each line is targetRepeatsBorderCharacter. Neighboring lines are complementary so that the nearest letter from one line to a neighboring line is the other target.  David Regan and colleagues (1992) reported that in testing foveal acuity of patients with poor fixation (e.g. nystagmus) it helps to have a "repeat-letter format" eye chart covered with letters of the same size, so that no matter where the eye lands, performance is determined by the letter nearest to the point of fixation, where acuity is best. We here extend that idea to crowding. We cover some part of the screen with an alternating pattern of two letters, like a checkerboard, so that the letters can crowd each other, and ask the observer to report both letters. Again, we expect performance to be determined by the letters nearest to the (unpredictable) point of fixation, where crowding distance is least. HORIZONTALLY, the two targets alternate, forming a line, and size and spacing are specified in the usual way. VERTICALLY. If there is more than one line, then the line spacing (baseline to baseline) is the product of spacingOverSizeRatio and the height of the bounding box of fontCharacterSet.\nIMPORTANT: Some fonts may require increased fontPadding higher than its default value in order to avoid clipping of the letters. Such a high padding may cause errors in target lateness and duration. EasyEyes reports targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec in the CSV file. \n• vernier Two vertical lines separated by a fixed vertical targetGapDeg and a variable horizontal targetOffsetDeg. See more text below.\n• gabor A gabor is the product of a Gaussian and a sinewave. As a function of space, the sinewave produces a grating, and the Gaussain vignettes it to a specific area, without introducing edges. Gabors are a popular stimulus in vision research because they have compact frequency and location.\n• image An image is randomly drawn, without replacement (for this condition in this block) from a folder whose name is specified by targetImageFolder. The image is displayed at the target eccentricity with the target size. The image aspect ratio is preserved.\n• movie EasyEyes uses javascript movieComputeJS, provided by the scientist to compute an HDR movie, newly generated for each trial, and allows targetTask to be identify or detect.\n• reading Measure reading speed and retention. Uses specified font and writing direction (fontLeftToRightBool). readingXXX parameters specify corpus and starting point, control font size (usually via letter-to-letter spacing in deg), number of characters per line, and number of lines per page, and determine how many alternatives in each retention question and how many retention questions. The set of alternatives consists of a target word and foils that have approximately the same frequency in the corpus. IMPORTANT: conditionTrials is ignored when targetKind==reading. \n• rsvpReading Flashes several words with Quest-controlled word duration. The parameter responseSpokenToExperimenterBool determines whether the trial\'s scoring is "spoken" (for children) or "silent" (for adults). In "silent" scoring, the participant sees a horizontal row of lines, each representing a shown word. Below each line is a list of possible words, including the correct one. The participant must select a word in each column to continue. readingXXX parameters specify how many alternatives for each word and how many retention questions. The set of alternatives consists of a target word and foils that have approximately the same frequency in the corpus.  In "spoken" scoring we assume that an experimenter sits next to the child participant, who reads the presented words aloud. Once the child has read the words aloud, the experimenter presses the SHIFT key to see the actual words, to guide scoring of what the child said. For each word, the experimenter presses either the up arrow for correct or down arrow for wrong. Supports fontLeftToRightBool for, e.g., Arabic.\n• sound A sound is randomly drawn, without replacement (for this condition in this block) from a folder whose name is specified by targetSoundFolder. The target sound is played for its full duration at level targetSoundDBSPL with a masker sound randomly selected from the maskerSoundFolder played at level maskerDBSPL. Also, in the background, we play targetSoundNoise at level targetSoundNoiseDBSPL.\n• vocoderPhrase. The targetSoundFolder and maskerSoundFolder each contain a hierarchy of folders containing 16-channel sound files. Each sound file is named for a word and contains the original or processed sound of that word (except that the file called "GoTo.wav" in fact contains the two words "go to"). The top level of folders in targetSoundFolder and maskerSoundFolder are folders of sounds produced by several talkers. Currently the talkers (Talker11, Talker14, Talker16, and Talker18) are all female. On each trial the target and masker are randomly assigned different talkers (never equal). Within each talker\'s folder are several loose word files (Now.wav, GoTo.wav, and Ready.wav), and several category folders (CallSign, Color, Number) that each contain several word files. Each trial follows text phrases provided in the parameters targetSoundPhrase and maskerSoundPhrase. Each phrase consists of a series of explicit words and category names, with each category name preceded by #. Currently the targetSoundPhrase is "Ready Baron GoTo #Color #Number Now", and the maskerSoundPhrase is "Ready #CallSign GoTo #Color #Number Now". The target and masker phrases are played at the same time, aligning the temporal midpoint of both words in each target-masker pair by symmetrically padding both ends of the briefer word with zeroes to make it the same length as the longer word. Each explicit word in each script is played every time. On each trial, each word category, marked by #, is replaced by a randomly selected word from that category folder, except that target and masker are always different from each other when either is drawn from a category.  On each trial, the target and masker phrases are combined by randomly taking targetSoundChannels (default 9) of the 16 channels of every word in the target phrase, and the remaining 16-targetSoundChannels channels from the masker words. The channel selection is consistent for all the words in the phrase, and new for each trial. targetSoundDBSPL specifies the sound level of the combined targetSoundChannels channels taken from each target word. Similarly maskerSoundDBSPL specifies the sound level of the combined 16-targetSoundChannels channels taken from each masker word. Also, we play targetSoundNoise at level targetSoundNoiseDBSPL. The Zhang et al. (2021) paper mentions a noise control, in which the masker is white noise that has been filtered into 16 bands and windowed into word-length durations. The scientist achieves this simply by providing a maskerSoundFolder made up of these 16-channel noises, each derived from a word. \nRESPONSE. After playing the phrase, EasyEyes displays two columns, one for each category word in the targetSoundPhrase. The observer must select one word in each column in order to proceed to the next trial. (This is forced choice.) We score the trial as right only if both responses are right. That overall right/wrong response is provided to QUEST, which controls the targetSoundDBSPL.⭑ \n\nVERNIER. Vernier acuity measures how well people can judge the alignment of two vertical lines across a small gap. Duncan and Boynton (2003) showed that psychophysically measured vernier acuity is highly correlated with the size (mm^2) of cortical area V1. \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627303002654\n     Two lines are presented so that the combination is centered on targetEccentricityXDeg and targetEccentricityYDeg. Imagine drawing one line going up from that point and another going down. To create the stimulus, we move those imaginary line segments in opposite directions horizontally and vertically. Vertically the upper line goes up by targetGapDeg/2, and the bottom line goes down by targetGapDeg/2. Horizontally we move the upper line right or left, by targetOffsetDeg (which is controlled by Quest), and the lower line by the same distance in the opposite direction. Despite displacement, the lines are vertical. \ntargetKind=\'vernier\', targetTask=\'identify\', thresholdParameter=”targetOffsetDeg”, targetEccentricityXDeg=0, targetEccentricityYDeg=0, targetThicknessDeg=5/60, targetLengthDeg=1, targetGapDeg=10/60, screenColorRGBA=”0,0,0,1”, targetColorRGBA =”1,1,1,1”, markingColorRGBA=”1,1,1,1”, targetDurationSec=0.15, instructionFontColorRGBA=”1,1,1,1”\n\nIf targetKind==\'vernier’ then the EasyEyes compiler will require targetTask==\'identify\' and thresholdParameter==”targetOffsetDeg”',

The (wrong) trials are collected in the normal way, so Quest keeps making the task easier. Practice trials count towards the number of trials you request through conditionTrials. \n1. FLUSH AFTER FIRST CORRECT RESPONSE. After the participant's first correct response in this condition, EasyEyes flushes Quest for this condition, to start fresh, with the original prior probability density, and the original requested number of trials. In terms of coding, the main change is the flush after the first correct response. The practice trials will be reported, as usual, in the Results CSV file, but won't be included in Quest's non-practice staircase.\n2. BUT START AT THE LEVEL THAT SUCCEEDED. Some participants may need the easy stimulus of their successful practice trial. So, to get things off on the right foot, for the first trial on the record, Quest will provide the same levelSuggestedByQuest as it provided in the successful practice trial. For this first on-the-record trial, EasyEyes uses the saved value of levelSuggestedByQuest, instead of asking Quest to compute it.\n\nBACKGROUND. Getting the first trial wrong is a frequent problem in testing children, and occasionally in testing adults. Quest then makes the next trial bigger, and the staircase typically doesn't recover. Mathematically, Quest is doing the right thing, under the assumption that the observer is stationary. However, people often goof on the first trial, getting an easy trial wrong, and this uncharacteristic (non-stationary) behavior biases Quest to test very easy stimuli that are not optimal for estimating threshold. Marialuisa and I came up with a simple rule to solve this problem. We suppose that people only become stationary AFTER their first correct response. I hope it'll be easy to implement because we start normally and just flush Quest's history after the first correct trial (including that correct trial).",

      "viewingDistanceAllowedRatio (default 1.1) must be greater than or equal to zero and specifies a tolerance interval around the desired viewing distance D = viewingDistanceDesiredCm. If viewingDistanceAllowedRatio>1, then the allowed range of viewing distance is \nD/viewingDistanceAllowedRatio to D*viewingDistanceAllowedRatio. \nIf it's <1 then the allowed range of viewing distance is \nD*viewingDistanceAllowedRatio to D/viewingDistanceAllowedRatio. \nA value of 0 allows all viewing distances. Enforcement is only possible when viewing distance is tracked. In that case, testing is paused while viewing distance is outside the allowed range, and the participant is encouraged to move in or out, as appropriate, toward the desired viewing distance. We call that \"nudging\".  \n\nNote: CSV and Excel files do not allow INF.\n\nTHE NUDGER. When viewing distance is outside the allowed range, the nudger puts up a full-screen opaque display telling the participant to MOVE CLOSER or FARTHER, as appropriate. (This is translated to the appropriate language.) The nudge display goes away when the participant is again within the allowed range. In our experience, the viewing-distance nudger (\"Closer\", \"Farther\") quickly gets the participant to the right distance, and they soon learn to stay there so they see this display only a few times. \n     On any trial, before computing the stimulus, EasyEyes will get a fresh estimate of viewing distance, and, if the nudger is not satisfied, wait until it is. EasyEyes waits until the nudger is satisfied, i.e. the estimated viewing distance is in the allowed range specified by viewingDistanceDesiredCm and viewingDistanceAllowedRatio. Use viewingDistanceAllowedPreciseBool=TRUE to show distance with an extra digit after the decimal. That's handy when you're checking it's accuracy.\n     We protect the stimulus from nudging. The nudger will never occlude, or forward or backward mask, the stimulus. Think of the trial as beginning at the participant's request for the stimulus (by keypress or clicking or tracking the crosshair) and ending at the click (or keypress) response. This leaves a pre-trial interval from the response until the click requesting the next trial. EasyEyes nudges only before and between trials. Furthermore, to prevent forward masking, EasyEyes ignores attempts to click (or press a key) during nudging and until targetSafetyMarginSec after nudging. Accepted clicks (or keypresses) produce a click sound. Ignored attempts are silent.\n\nPRE-TRIAL INTERVAL. We allow nudging from the time of response to the previous trial (click or keypress) until the participant requests a new trial (press space bar or click or track crosshair). \n\nSTIMULUS & RESPONSE INTERVALS. The stimulus and its memory are protected by disabling nudging from the moment of the participant's request for a new trial until the observer responds. \n\nThe trial software sets the internal parameter nudgingAllowedBool to TRUE only during the pre-trial, and sets nudgingCancelsTrialBool to always be FALSE.  The scientist cannot directly control nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool.\n\nFUTURE ENHANCEMENT ONCE WE CAN CANCEL TRIALS. If we acquire the possibility of canceling a trial, then we could allow nudging during the stimulus interval, and immediately cancel that trial. Once a trial has been canceled we do NOT wait for a response. Instead, we proceed directly to draw the crosshair for the next trial. Canceling a trial is not trivial. We need to put this trial's condition back into the list of conditions to be run, and that list needs to be reshuffled, so the participant won't know what the next trial will be. I suppose that what happened will be obvious to the participant, so we don't need to explain that the trial was canceled. I see two stages of implementation. First the trial software needs to provide and update two flags: nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool. The current version of MultistairHandler doesn't cope with trial cancelation. For now, the trial software sets nudgingAllowedBool to TRUE only during the pre-trial interval, and sets nudgingCancelsTrialBool to always be FALSE. Once we know how to cancel a trial, during the stimulus interval we'll set both nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool to TRUE. ",

      '🕑 viewMonitorsXYDeg x1,y1; x2,y2; x3,y3 accepts one or more xy coordinates, one per monitor, each of which specifies an xy eccentricity in deg. The default is no eccentricities, which disables this parameter. The block will be skipped, and an error flagged, if the computer does not have enough monitors.. It\'s ok to have more monitors than needed.\n     EasyEyes will suppose that the scientist probably, but not necessarily, wants the first eccentricity on the main monitor, e.g. the screen that the EasyEyes window first opens on. As a web app, I think that EasyEyes cannot directly measure how many monitors are available. It will display several small windows on the main screen, which each ask to be dragged to the appropriate monitor, e.g. "Drag me to the left monitor." or "Drag me to the middle monitor." or "Drag me to the right monitor.".\n     When using viewMonitorsXYDeg, we will typically have three monitors, and we’ll request three eccentricities. For example:\nviewMonitorsXYDeg 0,0; -60,0; 60,0\nor\nviewMonitorsXYDeg 0,0; 0,-60; 0,60\nThe first example is for testing the horizontal meridian; the second is for the vertical meridian. Each request asks EasyEyes to place three monitors, one for each eccentricity, with the monitor’s screen orthogonal to the observer’s line of sight (from the nearer eye) at the specified eccentricity. The point in the plane of the screen where the nearer eye\'s sight line is orthogonal to the flat screen. We refer to it as the screen’s nearest point.  The monitor should be placed so that the nearest point is at the specified viewingDistanceDesiredCm and eccentricity, and as near as possible to the screen center, while avoiding monitor collisions.\n     When viewMonitorsXYDeg provides N eccentricities, demanding N monitors. EasyEyes needs to know the size (width and height) and margins of each monitor. The first time, it will display N little windows on the main screen and ask the participant to drag each window to the monitor it belongs on. Then it will ask the participant to measure (in cm) and type in the each screen\'s width, height, and margins. It will save this, so for subsequent blocks of the same experiment there is minimal fuss.\n\nARGUMENT PARSING, CHECKED BY COMPILER: There can be zero or more xy coordinates, separated by semicolons. Each coordinate consists of two comma-separated numbers. Each number must be in the range ±180 deg. The tokens are numbers, commas, and semicolns. Spaces between tokens are ignored. So are leading and trailing spaces. Missing numbers are a fatal error. \n\nFUTURE: We plan to add general support for vectors and matrices. Syntax will be like MATLAB in using commas to separate elements in a row, and semicolons to separate rows. Thus viewMonitorsXYDeg will accept a 2×N matrix. with 2 elements per row, and any number of rows.',
