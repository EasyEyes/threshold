    explanation:
      'üïë _calibrateMicrophoneKeywords (see default below) is a list of keywords used to interpret the list of input devices returned by Web Audio on a mobile phone. On a desktop, Web Audio identifies which input device is in use. On a mobile device, Web Audio just gives a list of available input devices, which may include use of the loudspeaker as a microphone. For calibration purposes, EasyEyes assumes that the phone is using either its main built-in microphone or a connected external microphone. When connected to a smartphone by the QR-code technique, EasyEyes scans the enumerated list of sound input device "labels" returned by web audio. Any enumerated device whose label includes a keyword from the _calibrateMicrophoneKeywords list will be assumed to be the active external microphone, and that name will be reported as the web audio name of the Microphone. Keyword matching ignores case. If no label matches a keyword, then EasyEyes assumes that the microphone enumerated as "mics:0" is default and active, and returns its name, which on some phones is "Default". \n\nIf EasyEyes fails to detect a particular phone\'s microphone, you may be able help EasyEyes to catch it by adding a keyword to the default list and using that extended list. Conversely, if our list inadvertently contains a keyword that is causing a false alarm because it appears in a participant\'s phone\'s label for an internal sound-input source, you can create and use a new list without the problematic keyword.

    explanation:
      "_calibrateMicrophonesBool (default FALSE) enables calibration of new microphones, typically smartphone microphones. This is intended solely for use by a few sound experts (for now, Denis Pelli and his assistants), and requires a manufacturer-calibrated USB-connected miniDSP UMIK-1 or UMIK-2 microphone (available from Amazon for one or two hundred dollars) to calibrate the computer's loudspeakers. Then the calibrated loudspeakers are used to calibrate, one by one, any number of smartphone microphones.

This prevents a local connection (internal mic., USB mic., bluetooth mic. or Apple handoff), which, at least on a MacBook Pro, goes though the OS sound panel which often screws up efforts to calibrate sound. This is intended solely for use by scientists. We have been unable to get useful recording through a local connection, which all go through the Sound panel. It appears that despite our attempts to disable echoCancellation, noiseSuppression, and autoGainControl, the OS removes the calibration sounds, played through the loudspeaker, from the recording, which ruins the calibration. We were unabel to fix this, but we seem to get good recordings through a smartphone recruited through a QR code, so we're moving forward with that workaround. To use a calibrated mic (e.g. UMIK-1 from miniDSP) we attach it directly to the smartphone. We protect the scientist from bad calibration by disabling local connection by default. However, if you really want that, just set _calibrateMicrophonesOnlyViaPhoneBool=FALSE and you'll be allowed to record locally.",

  _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool: {
    name: "_calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool",
    availability: "now",
    type: "boolean",
    default: "TRUE",
    explanation:
      'üïë _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool (default TRUE) saves the scientist time by saving the screen calibration of screen size (in cm), and thereafter retrieving the size from a local cache instead of re-calibrating. It enables EasyEyes saving and reading a "cookie" (in the participant computer browser\'s localStorage) containing the screen position (px), resolution (px), and size (cm), e.g. (0,0) px; 3024‚úï1964 px, and 24.5‚úï16 cm. The "cookie" is only read if _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool==TRUE. If read, the "cookie" is considered valid only if it reports a screen position (left, top) px and resolution (width ‚úï height px) that match the current screen\'s position and resolution. \n\nIf calibrateScreenSizeBool==TRUE, and there\'s a valid cookie, then EasyEyes takes the screen size (width ‚úï height cm) from the cookie instead of measuring it. (EasyEyes measures screen size by adjusting the size of a credit card drawing to match the size of a real credit card.) At the end of size calibration, if _calibrateScreenSizeCacheBool==TRUE, then a "cookie" is saved, containing the screen position, resolution, and size. \n\nEasyEyes checks validity because it needs the size of the current screen, but the computer might have several screens, and the browser window could be opened on any of them. Similarly, the participant might replace a second screen. If the participant changes the screen resolution, then the "cookie" match will fail, and they\'ll have to recalibrate size. Similarly, localStorage is browser-specific, so if the participant switches browser, they\'ll have to recalibrate size. Those rare events represent only a minor inconvenience. This scheme is good because it is unlikely to mistake a new screen for an old one, and it uses one screen calibration to test many participants.\n\nThe credit card test measures only pxPerCm. We compute size (width and height in cm) from pxPerCm and the known resolution (width and height in px). Even so, screen size in cm is the more permanent property of the monitor because it is conserved when the participant uses an OS control panel to change to a new resolution with the same ratio of width to height. (If the new resolution has a different ratio of width to height, then the change in resolution will also slightly change the display area, i.e. size in cm.) ',

WHEN ENTERING SEVERAL NUMBERS IN ONE CELL, WE STRONGLY SUGGEST BEGINNING WITH A SPACE, AND PUTTING A SPACE AFTER EVERY COMMA. THIS PREVENTS EXCEL FROM MISINTERPRETING THE STRING AS A SINGLE NUMBER. Default is -60, -50, -40, -30, -20, -15,- 10, -3.1 (dB), where levelDB = 20*log10(rms), and rms is the root mean square of the digital sound vector. A sinewave with range -1 to +1, the highest amplitude that won't be clipped, has rms -3.1 dB. Microphones clip and may have dynamic range compression, so we measure the gain at many amplitudes and fit a model to the data. The model allows for an additive environmental background noise and dynamic range compression and clipping of the recoding with three degrees of fredom (T,W,R). Digital sound cannot exceed ¬±1 without clipping. Thus sin(2*pi*f*t) is at maximum amplitude. It has RMS amplitude of 0.707, which is -3.1 dB. IMPORTANT. Order your calibration sound levels so that loudness increases. The iPhone microphone has a slow dynamic range compression and measurement of a given digital sound level (e.g. -50 dB) made after measuring a much louder sound can be 6 dB lower than after a quiet sound. Your smartphone's clipping and dynamic range compression are not part of your experiment; we just need to get good sound level measurements during calibration. ",

      "_calibrateSoundBurstDownsample (default 1) is a positive integer N that specifies a lower MLS sample frequency of fMLS=fs/N, where fs is the sample frequency _calibrateSoundSamplingDesiredHz used by the loudspeaker and microphone. This is implemented by using fMLS instead of fs for synthesis and analysis of the MLS. Existing code yields an MLS sequence with the desired duration at a sampling frequency of fMLS. Then we replace each MLS sample, with associated rate fMLS, by N replicas of the sample, with associated rate fs=N*fMLS, which preserves duration. The sound is played and recorded at fs, and then downsampled by replacing each successive group of N samples by their average. The downsampled waveform has sampling frequency fMLS. We use our existing code to analyze the original MLS sequence and downsampled recording. \n\nEXPLANATION. Web audio allows setting of the sampling rate, but has only a few choices, the lowest of which is 44.1 kHz. I anticipate that when calibrating we'll use an N of 2. An fMLS = 24 kHz will yield an MLS with a white spectrum up to 12 kHz, which is well matched to our current upper cut off of 10 kHz. Halving the bandwidth at fixed power (and amplitude) doubles the power spectral density.

This is important in avoiding saturation (more likely of the loudspeaker than the microphone) which distorts the recording. The system identification approach used here assumes linearity, so nonlinear saturation distorts the derived impulse response. EasyEyes respects this limit by low pass filtering the filtered MLS. For a flat spectrum (like the MLS before filtering) power is proportional to bandwidth. The lowest possible bandwidth is slightly over 1 kHz because we use gain at 1 kHz as a reference, and that scheme would break if we filtered out 1 kHz. \nALSO SEE _calibrateSoundBurstDownsample.",

      "_calibrateSoundSamplingDesiredBits (default 24) specifies the desired number of bits per sample in recording during sound calibration. Some devices allow selection of number of bits, e.g. the miniDSP UMIK-2 offers 24 or 32 bits. The UMIK-1 is fixed at 24 bits. \n‚ö† The web audio calls to read the number of sampling bits are unreliable. When I use Apple's (reliable) Audio MIDI app to set the UMIK-2 bits to 32, the web audio API erroneously reports 16 bits, which is crazy, because the microphone offers only two bit depths: 24 and 32. Avoiding the unreliably web audio API for sampling bits, EasyEyes merely asks the participant to set the sampling bits, and trusts that it's done, since EasyEyes has no reliable way to check. Thus, EasyEyes reports only the \"desired\" bits per sample. In fact the setting is stable inside the UMIK-2 microphone, arrives from the factory in 24-bit mode, and we recommend leaving it at 24-bit mode. So there's not reason for it to ever change.\n‚ùå ‚ö†. 32-BIT MODE OF miniDSP UMIK-2 NOT RECOMMENDED. I've collected most of my data using the UMIK-2 set to 24 bits (at 48 kHz). Today (January 2025) I calibrated my loudspeaker more than six times with 24 and 32 bits, to compare. I focused on measured gain (in dB) at 1000 Hz, measured with sine or MLS.  I expected the change from 24 to 32 bits to preserve mean and slightly reduce the SD. To my surprise, with 32 bits, the mean measured gain is several dB lower, and the SD is much higher. Measuring with 1000 Hz sine, the mean gain dropped 2.3¬±0.3 dB, and the SD grew from 0.3 to 0.9 dB. Measuring with MLS, the mean gain at 1000 Hz dropped 5.2¬±1.4 dB, and the SD grew from 2.7 to 3.7 dB. I have not examined the actual 24- and 32-bit samples to try to figure out what the problem is. I made the measurements on only one of my UMIK-2 microphones (810-4281). However, more than a year ago, I noticed on several occasions that I get better data with 24 than with 32 bits. At the time, I thought this might be a data rate issue, but that's just a wild guess. One could test the data-rate hypothesis by redoing the comparison at a much lower sampling rate. 48 kHz is a very common sampling rate in audio work, so I'm surprised that 32 bits works poorly at this rate. It's also possible that the UMIK-2 works fine with apps, and that I'm hitting a limit unique to web apps. My computer is a MacBook Pro 14\" MacBookPro18,4 with M1 chip and 64 GB memory, which should perform well at high data rates. Thus, I'm unsure what the problem is, or how general it is, but I'm avoiding it by sticking to 24 bits, and I'm warning anyone who plans to use the UMIK-2 at 32 bits to first check that it works at least as well as at 24 bits.",

For example:\nhttps://www.minidsp.com/scripts/umikcal/umik90.php/7114754_90deg.txt\nThe microphone gain at frequency f_Hz is \ngain_dB(f_Hz) = _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB + SensFactor_dB + sensitivity_dB(f_Hz)\nwhere gain_dB is the level increase of digital power level out (dB) from sound level in (dB SPL), SensFactor_dB is read from the header of the microphone's calibration file, e.g. it's -1.198 dB in this header\n\"Sens Factor =-1.198dB, SERNO: 7114754\", \nand sensitivity_dB is read from the calibration file's table, which has one row per frequency.\n     _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB was determined for my two UMIK-1 microphones by using my 1 kHz 94 dB SPL Center 326 calibrator (which accepts any microphone tip diameter) and comparing with the free REW sound calibration app. The free REW app works with my two UMIK-1 mics and correctly reports my 1000 Hz 94 dB SPL Center 326 calibrator as 94 dB SPL (Z). So I worked out what value of _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB makes EasyEyes consistent with REW. That empirical approach succeeds, and replaces my earlier unsuccessful attempt to follow miniDSP's and REW's hard-to-read and apparently inconsistent documentation of what the \"Sens Factor\" means.\n     NOTE: _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB = -124.8 is much less than _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB = -100.\n     Center 326 Calibrator (accepts any microphone diameter up to 0.5\")\nhttps://www.akulap.de/joomla/index.php/de/shop/product/view/7/1",

    explanation:
      '_calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB (default -100) is the base gain (dB power out re dB SPL power in) of a UMIK-2 microphone (miniDSP, Hong Kong). It is used solely to interpret the serial-number-indexed UMIK-2 calibration file available online from miniDSP. The microphone gain at frequency fHz is \ngain_dB = _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB + SensFactor_dB + sensitivity_dB(fHz)\nwhere gain_dB is the level increase of digital power level out (in dB) from sound level in (in dB SPL), SensFactor_dB is read from the header of the microphone\'s calibration file, e.g. it\'s -10.58 in this header\n"Sens Factor =-10.58dB, AGain =18dB, SERNO: 8104281"., and sensitivity_dB is read from the table, which has one row per frequency. EasyEyes ignores "AGain" (see note below).\n     _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB was determined by observing the free REW sound calibration app using my two UMIK-2 microphones recording my Reed R8090 Calibrator playing 1 kHz at 94 dB SPL. The free REW app works with my two UMIK-2 mics and correctly reports my 94¬±0.5 dB SPL Reed R8090 calibrator as either 93.7 or 94.2 dB SPL (Z). So I worked out what value of _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB makes EasyEyes consistent with REW. The value of _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB is approximately -100, which is consistent with a blog comment apparently by John Mulcahy, who seems to run REW. miniDSP speaks highly of Mulcahy and his REW software.\nhttps://www.hometheatershack.com/threads/understanding-spl-offset-umik-1.134857/post-1319361\nThat empirical approach succeeds, and replaces my earlier unsuccessful attempt to follow miniDSP\'s and REW\'s hard-to-read and apparently inconsistent documentation of what the "Sens Factor" means.\n     "AGain" NOTE: Supposedly the gain of the UMIK-2 can be changed (maybe by opening the mic and setting a switch or by software, e.g. REW or Apple\'s "Audio MIDI Setup App"), and I suppose that "AGain=18dB" in the calibration file refers to that setting. However, I never changed the gain, and EasyEyes ignores the "AGain" parameter when reading the miniDSP UMIK-2 calibration file. "AGain" does not appear in the UMIK-1 calibration file.\n     NOTE: _calibrateSoundUMIK1Base_dB=-124.8 is much less than _calibrateSoundUMIK2Base_dB=-100.\n',

Similarly, the participant might replace a second screen. If the participant changes the screen resolution, then the "cookie" match will fail, and they\'ll have to recalibrate size. Similarly, localStorage is browser-specific, so if the participant switches browser, they\'ll have to recalibrate size. Those rare events represent only a minor inconvenience. This scheme is good because it is unlikely to mistake a new screen for an old one, and it uses one screen calibration to test many participants.\n\nThe credit card test measures only pxPerCm. We compute size (width and height in cm) from pxPerCm and the known resolution (width and height in px). Even so, screen size in cm is the more permanent property of the monitor because it is conserved when the participant uses an OS control panel to change to a new resolution with the same ratio of width to height. (If the new resolution has a different ratio of width to height, then the change in resolution will also slightly change the display area, i.e. size in cm.) ',

    explanation:
      "_needProcessorCoresMinimum (default 6) tries to exclude slow computers. The number of cores is a positive integer, also called \"hardwareConcurrency,\" whose value is returned by all modern browsers except Safari. When the API is not supported (i.e. on Safari), we estimate its value by doubling and rounding the rate (in MHz) at which the computer generates random numbers. That conversion is based on a correlation that we've observed between hardwareConcurrency and  computeRandomMHz. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor\n\nUPDATE. January 11, 2025. We just improved stimulus generation for acuity and crowding to pre-render the stimulus during the fixation task with opacity 0 and then show the target by merely setting its opacity to 1. This has greatly improved timing, i.e. targetMeasuredDurationSec and targetMeasuredLatenessSec. We also added a new parameter _needMemoryGB, which we recommend setting to 8. That will exclude Windows 10 computers that have only 4 GB. A quick test of timing with unconstrained cores shows that macOS produces bad latency and duration if it has only 2 or 4 cores. So, the default has been increased to 6.\n\nHISTORY. We were experiencing excess targetMeasuredDurationSec and targetMeasuredLatenessSec. We assumed that the excess time was a result of the computer being slow. After months of research, we conclude, instead, that the excess time is spent on heap allocation. Huge letters require allocating 100 or 200 MB of heap space for rendering, and heap allocation takes a time proportional to the allocation size, on the order of 100 ms for 100 MB. Furthermore, the amount of time needed to allocate that much heap space is strongly dependent on the amount of memory the computer has. Excluding Windows 10 computers with only 4 GB helps a lot.\n\nUsing Prolific, our experiments are occasionally invoked on slow computers that produce late and prolonged stimuli. EasyEyes measures lateness and duration and reports them as targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec in the CSV file. We find that setting _needProcessorCoresMinimum=6 nearly eliminated bad timing, but it also eliminates quite a few computers with good timing. You may prefer to set _needProcessorCoresMinimum lower, e.g. 4, to include most computers, and weed out the slow computers later, during data analysis, based on mean and SD of  targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec. \nNOTE: To make your computer harder to track, the Chrome extension DuckDuckGo spoofs the number of cores to 2. Any experiment requiring 3 or more cores will reject any participant whose computer spoofs having 2 cores. \nHIGH REJECTION RATE: As of January 2024, our experiments requiring 6 cores have good timing but their Device Compatibility page rejects about as many participants as it accept. EasyEyes records the reason for rejection\n\nTO THE SCIENTIST RECRUITING ONLINE: After compiling your experiment, copy the Device Compatibility statement from the EasyEyes compiler page into your spreadsheet's _online2Description to inform online participants in advance of all Device Compatibility requirements.

I suspect this is due to the cores requirement. We currently have no data on participants rejected by the Device Compatibility page. We're changing that to get data on the rejected computers, so we can figure out why they're rejected.) We prefer that solution because the participant can understand in a study description that we need a certain number of cores (and can check themselves), whereas they can't check timing themselves. We try to minimize the number of participants that we turn away at the Nees page (to not waste their time, and to avoid creating a situation where participants try to work around the Device Compatibility page limits), so it's better to require things that allow participants to assess elibility themselves, before reaching the Device Compatibility page.",

The alternative \"CSV\" results format returns one CSV file for each participant.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION. As the experiment is compiled (into a newly created repository in Pavlovia bearing the experiment's name), the compiler will use the current value (default or assigned) of _pavlovia_Database_ResultsFormatBool to set the Results Format in the experiment's Pavlovia dashboard to either ‚ÄúCSV‚Äù or ‚ÄúDatabase‚Äù.\n\nTHIS WAS IMPLEMENTED TO WORK AROUND A TEMPORARY PROBLEM (March 26 to April 18, 2024) IN PAVLOVIA'S CSV RESULTS FORMAT: Pavlovia‚Äôs CSV results format was broken, so that in columns after \"targeTask\" (roughly the 37th), the headers are one row down and begin again from the first header.

We can't think of a reason to do so, but the scientist can use the manual control in the Pavlovia dashboard to change the experiment's results format, overriding whatever was selected in the experiment spreadsheet.\n\nNOTE: To download a cursor file (_saveCursorPositionBool=TRUE), Pavlovia must use the CSV results format (_pavlovia_Database_ResultsFormatBool=FALSE, the default).

This is helpful when it's important to retain the same Pavlovia URL for your experiment, because another experiment links to it. It's also helpful for users without an institutional Pavlovia license, because assignment of credits in Pavlovia is specific to the repository, so it's more convenient to keep using the same repository.\n\nWithout an institutional license, Pavlovia requires assigning credit (money) to each experiment before it can run in RUNNING mode. (PILOTING mode is free, but only accessible manually within Pavlovia.) \n\nIf _pavloviaNewExperimentBool=TRUE (the default), then, when EasyEyes compiles your experiment, EasyEyes appends the smallest possible integer (at least 1) to the spreadsheet filename (without extension) to create a unique (unused) experiment name. That keeps versions apart, and keeps the data from each version in its own repository. \n     Setting _pavloviaNewExperimentBool=FALSE will reuse the old repo, instead of creating a new repo every time you compile.

  _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool: {
    name: "_pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool",

    type: "boolean",
    default: "TRUE",
    explanation:
      "_pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool helps EasyEyes optimize its behavior by indicating your preference for use of RUNNING or PILOTING mode while testing. Pavlovia offers two modes (RUNNING and PILOTING) for running your study. Remote data collection requires RUNNING mode. PILOTING mode is meant for checking and debugging and runs only from the Pavlovia console on the scientist's computer. The only advantage of the PILOTING mode is that it's always free. Unless your institution has a Pavlovia site license, RUNNING mode costs 22 pence per participant (in 2024), and requires assigning credits (money) in advance to each experiment. (Setting _pavloviaNewExperiment=FALSE allows you to request that EasyEyes keep reusing the same experiment name, as you compile new versions, so you can assign credits once to the experiment, when you begin testing, instead of before each compile.) Thus scientists with a site license will always prefer RUNNING mode. Without that license, scientists can save money by using PILOTING mode during development, and switch to RUNNING mode to test remote participants. The parameter _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool allows you to express your preference. With an institutional site license, you'll always want the default TRUE. Without an institutional site license, you can save money by setting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool=FALSE during development, and TRUE for the actual remote testing. Without a site license, if you don't mind the 22 p expense, you can use RUNNING mode throughout (use the default _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool=TRUE), and set _compileAsNewExperiment=FALSE to minimize the frequency at which you must assign credits to the experiment.\n\nOLD EXPLANATION. Setting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool TRUE (the default) streamlines the use of Pavlovia's RUNNING mode, and setting it FALSE streamlines the use of Pavlovia's PILOTING mode. _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool helps EasyEyes anticipate your preference in optimizing the EasyEyes user interface. EasyEyes uses a Pavlovia repository to hold your experiment. Pavlovia offers two modes for running your experiment, PILOTING and RUNNING. PILOTING mode is free, but can only be run directly from the Pavlovia dashboard, which prevents remote testing. RUNNING mode costs 20 pence per participant (this fee is waived if your instititution has a site license), and you get a URL for your study that you can send to your online participants. It is our guess that most EasyEyes users (like current Pavlovia users) will belong to institutions with Pavlovia site licenses, and thus have no usage fee. Thus, for most users, we suggest letting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool be TRUE (the default) to streamline the EasyEyes scientist page for RUNNING mode. When _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool is TRUE, you just submit your table to the EasyEyes compiler to receive your study URL, with no more clicks. That includes setting your experiment to RUNNING mode in Pavlovia. If _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool is FALSE, then your experiment remains in the INACTIVE mode, waiting for you to click the \"Go to Pavlovia\" button, where you'll use the Pavlovia dashboard to set your experiment to PILOTING mode and run it. (Pavlovia has no API by which EasyEyes could do this for you.) If your experiment is already in RUNNING mode you can still switch to PILOTING mode. ",

In Workspace mode you assign funds to a folder which has a name and a project ID (a roughly 24-digit hexadecimal number). You can have multiple studies in one project folder; they all share the same project ID. If your experiment table includes an _prolific1ProjectID number, then EasyEyes will use it and call Prolific in Workspace mode. If _prolific1ProjectID is empty or absent, then EasyEyes will call Prolific in pre-Workspace mode.  If you provide a wrong Project ID then you'll get an invalid address (404) when EasyEyes tries to access your Prolific workspace. EasyEyes assumes that Prolific is locked into one mode or the other. (In fact, Prolific allows you to upgrade your Prolific account from pre-Workspace into Workspace mode, but you cannot downgrade, which is fine since Workspace mode is better.) If EasyEyes calls Prolific in the wrong mode, the call fails to transfer vital information for your study, which you'll notice when you try to publish your study in Prolific. Currently EasyEyes can't tell which mode your Prolific account is in, and expects you to provide a _prolific1ProjectID if and only if Prolific is in Workspace mode. So if you arrive in Prolific, and find Prolific ignorant of your study, you probably guessed wrong about the mode of your Prolific account. Does your study in Prolific have a Prolific Project ID?

    explanation:
      '‚ùå _saveEachBlockBool works, but isn\'t recommended. Use _logFontsBool instead. \nWhen _saveEachBlockBool=TRUE (default is FALSE), the experiment will save to CSV as it begins each block. Thus, even if the participant abruptly quits or the computer freezes, the CSV file will always include the last active block. Usually _saveEachBlockBool will be FALSE because, unless absolutely necessary, we don‚Äôt want to use the internet in the middle of the session (to minimize delay and make the experiment more robust). But scientists will enable it when they want to know which block failed. \nSAVING. The extra saves enabled by _saveEachBlockBool are in addition to the always-performed saves at the beginning and "end" of the session. ("End" includes a shift of attention aways from the Compiler page, which is not the end if the participant returns.) All saves are alike in saving all currently known rows and parameters to the CSV file, and all saves are cumulative, only adding new data. The CSV file on Pavlovia is readable throughout, and grows in length with successive saves. EasyEyes first saves after the Requirements check, before the remote calibration (regardless of whether the remote calibrator runs), which is before the first block, and again at the "end," which includes four cases: 1. completion, 2. orderly termination through an error message or the escape mechanism including waiting out the "saving" window at the end, 3. closing the EasyEyes window before completion or termination, and 4. shift of browser focus away from the Compiler page before completion or termination. Saving does not end the experiment.  After shifting attention away, the participant can shift attention back to EasyEyes and continue the experiment, which will save again in any of the four ways. This can happen again and again. \nCAUTION: We introduced this in order to track down what happened to participants that are logged by Prolific and not Pavlovia. It helped, but some participants still escaped detection by Pavlovia. Also, we have the impression that enabling _saveEachBlockBool increased the probability of EasyEyes failing. So we introduced a new method, _logParticipantsBool, which is better. It seems not to cause failure and is more successful in detecting the participants who were undetected by Pavlovia. _logParticipantsBool saves a bit of data about the participant in a FormSpree server.  The data remains on that server and is automatically aggregated by Shiny when it analyzes the Pavlovia results. Shiny also aggregates the Proflific report if its included in the *.results.zip file of Pavlovia results. Our current advice is to enable _logParticipantsBool only if you\'re worried about Pavlovia failing to record participants that are logged by Prolific. ',

After the first condition, each successive condition (column) rightward must have the same block number as the one preceding it, or increased by +1.\n\nExcel can automatically compute the block number for each condition after the first. The first condition (in column C) is block 1. Assuming "block" is in cell A7, then set Excel cell C7 to 1. The next condition\'s block is in cell D7. If it\'s the same block, set it to "=C7". If it\'s a new block, set it to "=C7+1". Doing that for the block number in all your conditions will make it easier to edit your experiment.\n\nSHUFFLING.

      'blockShuffleGroups1 (default is empty) requests shuffling the order of groups of blocks within the experiment. A "group" is a set of contiguous blocks whose included conditions all have the same "group name" (an alphanumeric string).\n\nPINNING. Any group whose name begins with underscore "_" is pinned. For example, groups "_A" and "_group1" would be pinned. Unlike unpinned groups, a pinned group is not shuffled (with the other groups in its depth). Groups inside a pinned group still shuffle within it, as usual.\n\nThe number N at the end of the blockShuffleGroups(N) parameter name is its "depth". Larger numbers are "deeper". For example, blockShuffleGroups3 has depth 3 and is deeper than blockShuffleGroups2.\n\nThe implicit depth zero has one nameless group containing all blocks. For depth N, in the range 1 to 6, a group is defined by putting the same group name in all the conditions in one or more contiguous whole blocks in a blockShuffleGroups(N) row. blockShuffleGroups1 can be used alone. At greater depth, each group at depth N must be a subset of a containing group at depth N-1.\n\nblockShuffleGroups(N) specifies the groups at depth N. The groups will have various numbers of blocks. Order follows the left-to-right positions of the columns. Not all blocks need be in groups. Within each containing group (in the row immediately above), EasyEyes counts the groups (from left to right) \nwhose names don\'t start with underscore, creates a shuffled list of the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the total count, and then replaces the i-th group by the group whose index is i-th in the shuffled list. \n\nDeeper groups are shuffled before shallower groups. Shuffling preserves the total number of blocks and conditions. To ease analysis, despite shuffling, each block retains its original block number in the CSV results file. Blocks are performed and reported in the shuffled column order, left to right, so in the CSV results, the block number sequence will be nonmonotonic and will vary across participants.\n\nEasyEyes compiler requirements. Each cell in any blockShuffleGroups(N) row must be empty or have a group name. All the cells in a block must be the same. All the blocks in a group must be contiguous, and have the same group name.

After the size and/or distance calibration, if calibrationDistanceCheckBool is TRUE, then we will ask the participant if they have an appropriate measuring device (ideally a tape measure, meter stick, or yard stick; a 12" or 30 cm ruler could be used if we exclude long distances), and, if so, how long is it, and what are its units: decimal cm, decimal inches, fractional inches. If no device, then we skip the rest of the calibrations that need a measuring device. In our instructions, we can say "Use your ruler, stick, or tape to measure this." When receiving fractional inches we could either accept a string like "16 3/16" or we could have three fields that each accept an integer, and allow the user to tab from field to field: "?? ??/??". The last number must be 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. For round numbers, the numerator will be zero. After measuring screen size, we can ask them to use their ruler, stick, or tape to measure screen width. We can display a huge double headed arrow from left edge to right edge. After measuring viewing distance we can ask them to use ruler, stick, or tape to create three exact viewing distances that we then use the webcam to measure. We can request 12, 24, or 36 inches, or 30, 60, or 90 cm. (These are round numbers, not exactly equivalent.) \n     We have two ways of measuring viewing distance and I‚Äôd like to evaluate both. Our current scheme with the calibrator is to have a Boolean parameter for each calibration. We should have separate parameters for the two methods of measuring viewing distance so scientists can select none, either, or both. It would be interesting to compare the two estimates (direct vs indirect) of pupillary distance. We should always save the pupillary distance with the data. We can compare our population distribution with the textbook distribution. It might be an elegant check on our biometrics. \n     We could test people online and mention in our study description that they must have a tape measure, meter stick, or yard stick.  Readers of our article will like seeing data from 100 people online plus 10 experienced in-house participants. I think this will create confidence in the calibrations. For scientists that‚Äôs crucial.\n',

[From left to right, the first condition column (C) must have block=1, and the block number of each further nonempty column must be the same as or one more than the block number of the column to its left.] Use conditionEnabledBool to easily and reversibly omit conditions during development without deleting columns or renumbering blocks.\n     conditionEnabledBool ignores a column. To ignore a row, insert % as its first character in column A.\n     EXAMPLE. As noted above, disabling a column, unlike deleting it, doesn\'t affect block numbering. If you have three blocks and disable block 2, you\'ll be left with blocks 1 and 3 active, and the compiler won\'t complain.

Most experimenters will choose centerFixation, the default, which simply places fixation at the fixationOriginXYScreen. For peripheral testing, you might set fixationOriginXYScreen near one edge of the display to maximize the eccentricity of a target at the opposite edge. Fixation, whether on- or off-screen, is always internally specified as a point in (x,y) display coordinates in the plane of the display (origin at lower left corner). (When the crosshair moves, fixation moves with it. In that case we also refer to the fixed "nominal" fixation at the static center of the motion.) The compiler requires that all conditions in a block have the same fixation point, fixationLocationStrategy, and fixationOriginXYScreen.\n‚Ä¢ centerFixation places fixation at the fixationOriginXYScreen. This is the default.\nüïë ‚Ä¢ centerTargets sets the (possibly offscreen) fixation location so as to maximize the screen margin around the edges of all the possible targets.

We generally don\'t know the screen size at compile time, as each participant has their own computer. Currently the scientist can only specify viewing distance as a fixed number of cm. \n\n[Since short viewing distances are uncomfortable, it might be useful to be able to request the maximize viewing distance such that the screen will have a needed visual subtense.

      '‚≠ë font specifies the font used to draw the target and text for reading. The compiler checks for font availability and issues a compile-time error if this fails. (However, fontSource="browser" can only be checked at runtime.) How you specify the font depends on the chosen fontSource:\n\nfile: font is the filename (including the extension: .woff2, .woff, .otf, or .ttf) of a font file in your EasyEyes Resources:Fonts folder in your Pavlovia account. Web font experts strongly recommend that you use the WOFF2 format, if you have it, instead of any other, because it\'s the smallest (half of OTF), for fast download, and is supported by all modern browsers. The compiler will download the font file from your Fonts folder in your Pavlovia EasyEyesResources repo to your temporary local Experiment folder, which is then uploaded to a new Pavlovlia repo for your experiment.  (Other font types, e.g. SVG and EOT, are not widely supported by browser implementations of the @font-face command.)\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face\n\ngoogle: font is the filename (without extension) of a font file provided by the free Google Font server. \n\nadobe: font contains the web font name as recognized by the Adobe Fonts server. \n‚Ä¢ To discover an Adobe font‚Äôs exact web name, find the font‚Äôs page in https://fonts.adobe.com/.  In that page‚Äôs lower right corner, find ‚ÄúTo use this font on your website‚Äù. Copy the ‚Äúfont-family‚Äù up to the first comma. E.g. if you see font-family: proxima-nova, sans-serif; copy just ‚Äúproxima-nova‚Äù.\n‚Ä¢ Some Adobe fonts are free and can be accessed through a free Adobe Creative Cloud account. Most require a paid Adobe Creative Cloud account. Adobe offers full-price and educationally-discounted subscriptions.\nhttps://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html\n\ntypeSquare: font contains the font name as recognized by the TypeSquare Fonts server (primarily for Japanese fonts). TypeSquare requires an account. TypeSquare allows limited free use. \nhttps://typesquare.com/en/\n\nbrowser: The experiment will pass the font preference string that you place in font to the participant\'s browser and accept whatever the browser provides.  Your string can include several font names, separated by commas, first choice first, to help the browser find something close to your intent. This is the usual way to select a font on the web, and never generates an error.  Specify just the family name, like "Verdana", and use the "fontStyle" to select italic, bold, or bold-italic. Some "web safe" fonts (e.g. Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, Courier New, Brush Script MT) are available in most browsers. In ordinary browsing, it\'s helpful that browsers freely substitute fonts so that you almost always get something readable in the web page you\'re reading. In the scientific study of perception, we usually don\'t want data with a substituted font. So, normally, you should specify "file" or "server" so you\'ll know exactly what was shown to the participant. \n\nEasyEyes preloads all fonts. At the beginning of the experimen, EasyEyes preloads all needed fonts, for the whole experiment (all conditions), so, after preload, the experiment runs with no font-loading delay and no need for internet, except to save data at the end.\n\nLICENSING. Fonts are intellectual property, and you normally need a license to use them. Buying a font for "desktop" use typically gets you an OTF or TTF font file and a license for desktop use. Buying for "web" use typically gets you WOFF and WOFF2 font files and a license for web use. Using a font with EasyEyes is web use. If you don\'t have a WOFF or WOFF2 file, an OTF or TTF file will work, but beware of the possibility that you may not have a license to use it on the web. Most font designer struggle to make a living. We should pay the license fees to use their fonts.\n\nZAPFINO. EasyEyes works well with all but one of the many fonts we\'ve tried. The exception is Zapfino. Zapfino text is always left of where it should be by 14% of the nominal font size. The error is surprising. We don\'t have a theory to explain it. We implemented fontPixiMetricsString to fix this, but it has no effect. [Note that Zapfino requires fontPadding of at least 0.5.] ',

This has the intended effect with Arabic, and has no effect in the Roman alphabet. Still untested with other alphabets, e.g. Persian. In Arabic, ligatures respond to the neighboring letters. To test crowding we set thresholdParameter=spacingDeg and targetKind=letter. When we identify crowded Arabic letters in typographic mode, the target character is displayed in medial shape (i.e. connected) as a stimulus. If fontMedialShapeResponseBool is TRUE (the default) then the response screen also shows each response letter in its medial shape. If FALSE, then the response letter is shown in its isolated shape (i.e. disconnected). Having the target letter change shape between stimulus and response screens may make it harder to identify, especially by less fluent readers. To achieve this, when fontMedialShapeResponseBool is TRUE we precede the response character by a Tarweel joiner character (U+0640) and follow it by a zero-width joiner (ZWJ) character (U+200D).

For each of 23 fonts here is the minimum value of fontPadding for no clipping (Maria Pombo, September, 2024).\nFont        Foundry        fontPadding\nAgoesa        Megatype        0\nArial Regular        Monotype        0\nExtenda 10 Pica        Zetafonts        0\nFrutiger Pro 55 Roman        Linotype        0\nHaut Relief        Nick's Fonts        0\nLetraflex Regular        Art Grootfontein        0\nMuseo Sans 500        exljbris Font Foundry        0\nTiny 5x3 100        Velvetyne        0\nBaskerville Pro Regular        Paratype        0.1\nCourier Prime        Google        0.1\nGeorgia Regular        Microsoft        0.1\nLiebeLotte        LiebeFonts        0.1\nOMFUG        Catkie        0.1\nProxima Nova        Mark Simonson Studio        0.1\nSabon Next Pro Regular        Linotype        0.1\nScarlet Wood Bold        supertype        0.1\nThe Sans Plain        LucasFonts        0.1\nTimes New Roman        Monotype        0.1\nAdobe Caslon Regular        Adobe        0.2\nLe Monde Livre Std Regular        Typofonderie        0.2\nRollerscript Smooth        G-Type        0.2\nEdwardian Script ITC Pro Regular        ITC        0.4\nPelli        denis.pelli@nyu.edu        0.5\nZapfino Extra Pro Regular        Linotype        0.5\nRed indicates that the font require more than the default (0.2) fontPadding to render without clipping.\n\n2. TIMEOUTS. By \"timeout\", we mean excess target lateness or a duration that is unacceptably short or long, relative to the requested targetDurationSec. The scientist sets timeout limits by assigning values to thresholdAllowedDurationRatio (default 1.5) and thresholdAllowedLatenessSec (default 0.1). A trial that exceeds any of these bounds is recorded in the CSV results file, but is not passed on to QUEST, so it doesn't contribute to the threshold estimate. Ideally EasyEyes would schedule a replacement trial, but PsychoJS doesn't yet support that (though PsychoPy does). You may have to reduce fontPadding, accepting some clipping, to minimize the loss of trials on slower computers. If possible, switch to a faster font, i.e. one that times out less. For a value of 0.5 of a lacy font, 62% of Prolific participants had no timeouts, 31% had timeouts in less than 10% of the trials, and the remaining 7% of participant lost most trials due to timeouts. Most timeouts were caused by a high targetMeasuredLatenessSec. Slower computer tolerate less fontPadding of large lacy fonts.\n\n3. ASSESSMENT. For your chosen font and fontPadding, at the largest size you need, assess timeouts by plotting histograms of targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec from the CSV results file. (Press \"Download results\" button on the EasyEyes compiler page.) To analyze crashes use _logFontBool, which saves the details of every font rendering, so you can examine the last one before the crash. (Use EasyEyes > Analyze to examine crash results.) The maximum safe value of fontPadding will be lower for slower computers, which are common online. Use thresholdAllowedDurationRatio and thresholdAllowedLatenessSec to specify what's acceptable.",

It applies only to reading experiments (both ordinary reading, targetTask=identify, targetKind=reading, and RSVP reading, targetTask=identify, targetKind=rsvpReading) and letter experiments (targetTask=identify, targetKind=letter, spacingRelationToSize=typographic). Scientist must manually adjust parameters to ensure that the stimulus does not expand beyond the window.\n\nFor example, with the Sloan font (whose nominal size equals the letter width and height, and which by default has no gap between letters), setting fontTrackingForLetters=1 separates letters by one letter width. In many fonts the x height is approximately equal to half the nominal size. In that case setting fontTrackingForLetters=0.5 will insert an x-height worth of spacing between letters.\n\nUses the relatively new "letterSpacing" Canvas command to adjust the spacing between letters.

Variable fonts have one or more axes of variation, and fontVariableSettings allows you to pick any value along each axis to control the font rendering. You set all the axes at once. Any axis you don\'t set will be set to its default. Each axis has a four-character name. Standard axes have all-lowercase names, like \'wght\' for weight. Novel axes are called "unique" and have ALL-UPPERCASE names, like \'GRAD\', which (in Roboto Flex) adjusts letter weight without affecting line length. fontVariableSettings receives a string. A typical value is\n"wght" 625\nor\n"wght" 625, "wdth" 25\nYou pass the whole line as a string, INCLUDING the quote marks, but not the RETURN. The string is passed to the CSS function font-variation-settings. The (single or double) quote marks are required. Each four letter code represents an axis of variation supported by the particular variable font. "wght" is weight, which allows you to select any weight from extra thin, to regular, to bold, to black. "wdth" is width, which allows you to select any width from compressed to regular to expanded. (We\'re not sure, but we anticipate no error and no effect of using an unsupported axis name.) All modern browsers support variable fonts. Internet Explorer does not.\n\nYOUR FONT\'S AXES. To discover your variable font\'s axes of variation, and their allowed ranges, try this web page: https://fontgauntlet.com/. Or assign your font to some text in Adobe Illustrator.

It\'s a Google Sheets file called "EasyEyes International Phrases".\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AZbihlk-CP7sitLGb9yZYbmcnqQ_afjjG8h6h5UWvvo/edit#gid=0\nThe first column has mnemonic phrase names. Each of the following columns gives the corresponding text in a different language. After the first column, each column represents one language. Each row is devoted to one phrase. The second row is languageNameEnglish, with values: English, German, Polish, etc. The third row is languageNameNative, with values: English, Deutsch, Polskie, etc. \n     We incorporate the latest "EasyEyes International Phrases" file when we compile threshold.js. For a particular experiment, we only need the first column (the mnemonic name) and the column whose heading matches instructionLanguage. We should copy those two columns into a Javascript dictionary, so we can easily look up each mnemonic phrase name to get the phrase in the instructionLanguage. To display any instruction, we will use the dictionary to convert a mnemonic name to a unicode phrase. \n     languageDirection. Note that most languages are left to right (LTR), and a few (e.g. Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, and Hebrew) are right to left (RTL). Text placement may need to take the direction into account. The direction (LTR or RTL) is provided by the languageDirection field.\n     languageNameNative. If we later allow the participant to choose the language, then the language selection should be based on the native language name, like Deustch or Polskie, i.e. using languageNameNative instead of languageNameEnglish.',

When the experiment is compiled, the movie program must already have been uploaded through the EasyEyes submission box. The program must define and fill the ‚ÄúmovieNit‚Äù array. The program can use several predefined variables, including: movieRectPx, tSec, xyDeg, xDeg, and yDeg, as well as the EasyEyes input parameters targetContrast, targetEccentricityXDeg, targetEccentricityYDeg, targetCyclePerDeg, targetHz, targetPhaseDeg, targetOrientationDeg (clockwise from vertical), targetSpaceConstantDeg (the 1/e radius), targetTimeConstantSec, movieRectDeg, and movieLuminanceNit.

Each movie trial, computes a movie by first running the scientist\'s movieComputeJS and then passing it through the ffMPEG encoder. Here are some results using tiltedFlickeringGrating.js on Chrome on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020), asking ffMPEG to use the avc1 : libx264 codec. Total prep time (watching the wait icon) grows linearly with the product of pixels per frame and number of frames. \ntimeSec = 1 + MPix*frames/4\nwhere timeSec is the prep time in seconds, MPix means a mega pixel, i.e. one million pixels, and frames is the number of frames in the movie. 25% of this is the runtime of the tiltedFlickeringGrating.js, and 75% is ffMPEG. The formula for just ffMPEG is\nffMpegSec = 0.7 + MPix*frames/6\nThe 6 MPix/s rate seems fine. The fixed 0.7 s overhead is surprising.

EasyEyes provides the width*height*2 array xyDeg[i,j,k], where each 2-number element (indexed by k) is the x,y position in deg of pixel i,j. Use of the xyDeg array does not allow speed up by computational separation of x and y, so you may prefer to use the separable approximation provided by the width-long vector xDeg and height-long vector yDeg, which provide approximate visual coordinates of the pixels in movieRectPx. (Note: xyDeg takes time and space for EasyEyes to compute, and not all movieComputeJS programs need it, so EasyEyes skips making xyDeg if the string  "xyDeg" is not found in the movieComputeJS file.)\n\nEXAMPLE: movieComputeJS might contain the filename "VerticalGrating.js", and that file might contain:\n// Compute vertical Gabor.\nvar imageNit = new Array(xDeg.length).fill(0)\n        .map(() => new Array(yDeg.length).fill(0));\nvar gx = [];\nvar gy = [];\nfor (const x of xDeg) {\n        gx.push(\n                Math.exp(-((x-targetEccentrictyXDeg)/targetSpaceConstantDeg)**2)\n        );\n}\nfor (const y of yDeg) {\n        gy.push(\n                Math.exp(-((y-targetEccentrictyYDeg)/targetSpaceConstantDeg)**2)\n        );\n}\nvar fx = [];\nfor (i = 0; i < xDeg.length; i++) {\n        fx[i]=gx[i]*Math.sin(\n                2*Math.PI*((xDeg[i]-targetEccentrictyXDeg)*targetCyclePerDeg + targetPhase/360)\n        )\n}\nfor (j = 0; j < yDeg.length; j++) {\n        for (i = 0; i < xDeg.length; i++) {\n                imageNit[i][j] = (255/2) * (1 + targetContrast * gy[j] * fx[i]);\n        }\n}',

Note that straight lines in visual space generally correspond to curves in pixel space. However, the HDR movie must be a screen rect (horizontal & vertical rectangle), so EasyEyes defines the movieRectPx screen rect approximation to movieRectDeg. movieRectDeg is rectangular on the retina, and movieRectPx is rectangular on the screen. \n     movieRectPx is the screen rect used for the movie.

The issue, of course, is that a rect on the screen (px coordinates) when mapped to the retina (deg coordinates) is not a rect, all four sides are curved. Similarly, a rect on the retina (deg coordinates) when mapped to the screen (px coordinates) is not a rect, all four sides are curved.

This is used in two way, first, in the Device Compatibility page, to reject a computer screen that doesn't have enough pixels, and second, at the beginning of each block, to reduce viewing distance below viewingDistanceDesiredCm, if necessary, to provide the needed angular screen width.\n\n1. REQUIRE SCREEN RESOLUTION ON DEVICE-COMPATIBILITY PAGE, i.e. set minimum width and height in px. The Device Compatibility page computes and enforces a minimum screen resolution. For each block, needScreenWidthDeg, needScreenHeightDeg, needTargetAsSmallAsDeg, and targetMinPhysicalPx are combined to compute minimum screen-width px and screen-height pix. The max width and height across all blocks is enforced in the Device Compatibility page.\n\nIf you use needScreenWidthDeg solely to control viewing distance, with no desire to set a minimum screen resolution, just set needTargetAsSmallAsDeg to a large value, e.g. 1, since needTargetAsSmallAsDeg is used solely to set the required screen resolution.\n\nEasyEyes ignores any conditions disabled by conditionEnabledBool = FALSE, and similarly ignores any block disabled by virtue of having all its conditions disabled.\n\nRequired screen resolution is computed from five parameters from the experiment spreadsheet, conditionEnabledBool, targetMinPhysicalPx, needTargetAsSmallAsDeg, needScreenWidthDeg, and needScreenHeightDeg, plus the monitor's physicalPxPerPx, retrieved by a web API. For each block, EasyEyes first computes max of the required target pixel density (px/deg) across enabled conditions:\nminPxPerDeg = max((targetMinPhysicalPx / physicalPxPerPx) / needTargetAsSmallAsDeg)\nacross enabled conditions in the block. Then it computes max of the required screen subtense (deg) across enabled conditions in each block:\nminScreenHeightDeg = max(needScreenHeightDeg)\nand\nminScreenWidthDeg = max(needScreenWidthDeg)\nHaving computed minPxPerDeg, minScreenHeightDeg, and minScreenWidthDeg for each block, EasyEyes computes the minimum screen resolution for each block:\nminScreenWidthPx = minPxPerDeg * tand(minScreenWidthDeg/2) / tand(1/2)\nminScreenHeightPx = minPxPerDeg * tand(minScreenHeightDeg/2) / tand(1/2)\nwhere tand is the tangent function modified to accept the angle in deg, i.e.\ntand(x) = tan(x*pi/180)\nThe required minimum resolution for the experiment is the max required resolution \nmax(minScreenWidthPx)\nand\nmax(minScreenHeightPx)\nacross all enabled blocks. These requirements are declared and enforced on the Device Compatibility page, which rejects any computer screen with insufficient resolution (i.e. pixels).\n\n2. ADJUST VIEWING DISTANCE OF EACH BLOCK. The EasyEyes compiler requires viewingDistanceDesiredCm to be the same across conditions in a block, but allows it to differ across blocks. needScreenWidthDeg is used, at the beginning of each block, to reduce viewing distance below viewingDistanceDesiredCm, if necessary, so that the screen will have at least the requested width in deg. Default is zero, which is ignored. \nmaxViewingDistanceCm = screenWidthCm/(2*tand(needScreenWidthDeg/2)).\nSet the block's viewing distance to \nmin(maxViewingDistanceCm, viewingDistanceDesiredCm).\n\n3. PRACTICAL ADVICE. Modern displays have a lot of pixels, so you might be tempted to do all your testing at one viewing distance. However, no display on the market has enough pixels for you to use the same viewing distance to measure foveal acuity (with needTargetAsSmallAsDeg=0.03) and peripheral crowding (with needScreenWidthDeg=30). The solution is to use a block with long viewing distance to measure foveal acuity (needTargetAsSmallAsDeg=0.03), and another block, with short viewing distance, to measure peripheral vision (with needScreenWidthDeg=30).\n\n3.

The TestScreenResolution.xlsx spreadsheet emulates the EasyEye Display Compatibility page computation of required screen resolution (px).\n\nAlso see needScreenHeightDeg, needScreenWidthDeg, needTargetAsSmallAsDeg, targetMinPhysicalPx",

Average English word length is 5 characters. Adding the space between words yields 6 characters per word. Multiplying 8-10 by 6 yields 48 to 60 letter widths per line. Line breaking without hyphenation will produce an average line length about half a word less than the max. To get an average line length of 9 words, set the max to 9.5 words, or 9.5*6¬†=¬†57 characters.  \n\nTEXT PLACEMENT. We want text placement for ordinary reading to cope with a wide range of sizes of window and text block. We want the text placement to have consistent margins from page to page, independent of the actual text. So, using only the provided parameters, EasyEyes computes the expected width and height of the block of text, and centers that rect in the window. The expected width of the text block is \nreadingBlockWidthPx¬†=¬†maxPixPerLine, \nwhose computation is explained above. The expected height of the text block is \nreadingBlockHeightPx = readingLinespacingPx*readingLinesPerPage\nCenter that invisible rect in the window.

As potential target or foil words we reject any strings in the concordance that include a hyphen.\n     CHOOSE FOILS. We pick a random integer from 1 to N to determine the rank order frequency of the target among the foils. We reduce the concordance by striking out all the words that were read (whether to be tested or not), except the target, which remains. As our answer set, we take N consecutive words from the reduced concordance, including the target, chosen so that the target has the randomly specified frequency rank (1 to N). If the target frequency is so high or low that the reduced concordance lacks N successive words with the target at the designated rank order, then we reject that target and pick another, using the same random rank.

"x-height" is a metric property of text, the height of the lowercase x. Unlike x-height, when you typeset a particular font (e.g. Helvetica) at a particular font "size" (e.g. 12 pt), all metrics of the typeset characters vary across fonts, because typographic tradition allows the type designer to choose an arbitrary size for (say) 12 pt type.

When thresholdParameter is "spacingDeg", spacingRelationToSize specifies how target size depend on center-to-center target-flanker spacing. And when thresholdParameter is "targetSizeDeg", spacingRelationToSize specifies how spacing depend on size.\n‚Ä¢ none means no dependence. Size and spacing are set independently. \n‚Ä¢ ratio means accept the thresholdParameter (which is either spacingDeg or targetSizeDeg) and adjust the other one to satisfy the specified spacingOverSizeRatio. There are two flankers, inner and outer. In general each has a different (center to center) spacing to the target. "ratio" refers to the ratio of spacing to target size. Set spacingIsOuterBool to choose whether size scales with inner (FALSE) or outer (TRUE) spacing.\n‚Ä¢ typographic prints the triplet (flanker, target, flanker) as a (horizontal) string (horizontally) centered on the specified target eccentricity. By "horizontal" and "vertical", we just mean the orientation of the baseline, and orthogonal to it. ("Vertically," the fontCharacterSet bounding box is centered on the eccentric location, and all letters in the string are on same baseline.) If thresholdParameter is "spacingDeg" then the font size of string is adjusted so that the width of the string is 3√ó the specified spacing. Works with both left-to-right and right-to-left fonts. [If thresholdParameter is "targetSizeDeg" then EasyEyes adjusts the font size of the string to achieve the specified target size.] \n\nTYPOGRAPHIC. Rule for positioning the stimulus string (one acuity letter or three crowding letters) in typographic mode.\nHORIZONTALLY. It‚Äôs a string and EasyEyes doesn‚Äôt know where one letter ends and the next begins. At the beginning of the trial, before the fixation task, set font size to fontReferenceSizePx (i.e. convert px to pt, and use that to set font size), and ask PIXI for our string\'s "width" in px. Width is the (horizontal) displacement from initial to final pen position when the string is drawn. For generality, divide it by fontReferenceSizePx,  \nwidthPxReFontSize = width / fontReferenceSizePx\nLooking ahead, we will take the horizontal midpoint of the string to be halfway between the start and end pen positions. \nVERTICALLY. In the spirit of good typography, we believe that the vertical position of the text baseline should be independent of the particular letters being displayed. To achieve that, the vertical positioning of the target string is based on the whole alphabet in use, which is conserved from trial to trial. At the beginning of the block, EasyEyes sets the font size to fontReferenceSizePx and measures a true bounding box for the fontCharacterSet string. Retain only topPx and bottomPx. For generality, subtract initial pen y position and normalize by fontReferenceSizePx. This gives us \ntopPxReFontSize = (topPx-penY)/fontReferenceSizePx\nand\nbottomPxReFontSize = (bottomPx-penY)/fontReferenceSizePx\nWe will need it later, so also use the code below to get "ascent" from PIXI, and compute\nascentPxReFontSize = ascent / fontReferenceSizePx.\n\nNow create\nboundsRectReFontSize=\n  [[0,bottomPxReFontSize], [widthPxReFontSize,topPxReFontSize]]\nBefore drawing the target, EasyEyes scales the rect up to the actual font size, \nboundsRect=fontSIzePx*boundsRectReFontSize\nand computes a new rect like boundsRect, but centered on the target eccentricity.\ncenteredRect=boundsRect - CenterOfRect(boundsRect) + targetEccentricityXYPx\nIf showBoundingBoxBool==TRUE then draw centeredRect with a blue line. \nCompute the pen position, typically a bit above the upper left corner of our rect.\npenX = centeredRect[0,0] - boundsRect[0,0];\npenY = centeredRect[1,1] - boundsRect[1,1];\nand draw the text there. It should fit the bounding box quite well. [Vertically our bounds allow for any character in fontCharacterSet, and horizontally, our bounding box considers only the pen positions, ignoring any long horizontal flourishes.]\nIf showBoundingBoxBool==TRUE also draw a horizontal green line representing the baseline, from end of end of our bounding box, at height baselinePx\nbaselinePx = penY - fontSIzePx*ascentPxReFontSize\n\nEXPLAINING THE BASELINE \nIn digital typography, the "pen position" at start and end of drawing a string is traditionally on the baseline. This is true of HTML Canvas, but currently EasyEyes is built on PsychoJS which renders text using PIXI.js which considers the pen position to be the upper left corner of the "bounding box" around the string. (I think the vertical extent of their "bounding box" is sized to hold any characters, not the just the ones in your string.) In PIXI, the baseline is "ascender" px below the pen position. Here is javascript code from ChatGTP to get the value of ascender from PIXI.\n\n// 1. Create text style\nconst textStyle = new PIXI.TextStyle({\n  fontFamily: \'Arial\',\n  fontSize: 24,\n  fill: \'black\',\n});\n\n// 2. Create text object\nconst textObj = new PIXI.Text(\'Hello World\', textStyle);\ntextObj.x = 100; // Pen position x\ntextObj.y = 50;  // Pen position y (top-left corner)\n\n// 3. Measure text\nconst metrics = PIXI.TextMetrics.measureText(textObj.text, textObj.style);\n\n// 4. Get ascent (vertical offset to baseline)\nconst ascent = metrics.fontProperties.ascent;\n\n// 5. Calculate baseline position\nconst baselineY = textObj.y + ascent;\n\n// 6. Output the results\nconsole.log(\'Pen Position (Top-Left Corner):\', textObj.x, textObj.y);\nconsole.log(\'Vertical Offset to Baseline (Ascent):\', ascent);\nconsole.log(\'Baseline Position Y:\', baselineY);',

We refer to the center-to-center spacing from target to inner and outer flankers as the inner and outer spacings. Parameter spacingDeg specifies the outer spacing. spacingSymmetry affects only the inner spacing, which is calculated to make the two flanker spacings symmetric in one of three ways: at the screen (i.e. equal in pixels), at the retina (i.e. equal in deg), or at the cortex, i.e.  log(outer+eccDeg + 0.15)-log(eccDeg + 0.15)=log(eccDeg + 0.15)-log(eccDeg-inner + 0.15), where eccDeg is the target\'s radial eccentricity in deg.

(\"Without replacement\" considers all the trials of this condition of this block. Other conditions and blocks are independent.)\n\nThe folder is submitted as a zip archive to the EasyEyes drop box, and saved in the EasyEyesResources repository of the scientist's Pavlovia account. To be clear: The scientist creates a suitably named folder full of images, and zips that; the zip archive inherits the name of the folder. Each file in the folder must have one of the allowed image-file extensions: APNG, AVIF, GIF, JPEG, JPG, JP2, PNG (can be 16 bit), SVG, or WebP. (JPG is just an abbreviation of the JPEG extension; JP2 indicates JPEG 2000.) Different files can have different extensions. No subfolders are allowed. An experiment uses the folder by setting targetImageFolder to the name of the zip archive, without the extension.\n\nCOLOR MANAGEMENT. 16-bit png or jpeg2000 are rendered with 10-bit rendering (on capable hardware) and HDR. The browser's color-managed rendering will take into account the ICC color profiles of the image and display (including a stub RGB profile referring to the standard RGB profile.). For accurate image rendering, each image should have an embedded ICC color profile. (The informal convention of assuming an sRGB profile when none is embedded seems too unreliable, across browsers, for research-grade stimuli.) \n\nHDR. A large proportion of computer displays produced in recent years support 10 bits per color channel, and most browsers now use the 10 bits when displaying HDR (High dynamic range) images using the HTML <img> tag. Several Netflix engineers studied how to achieve 10-bit display on current browsers using available image formats.\nhttps://netflixtechblog.com/enhancing-the-netflix-ui-experience-with-hdr-1e7506ad3e8\nThey recommend using 16-bit PNG or JPEG 2000. 16-bit PNG is supported by the several browsers we tested. As of September 2022, Safari was the only browser supporting JPEG 2000.\nhttps://caniuse.com/jpeg2000\nSurprisingly, another web page claims that JPEG2000 is also supported by Chrome and Firefox.\nhttps://fileinfo.com/extension/jp2\n\nFUTURE: When the images have diverse size the scientist can instead specify image pixels per degree.\n[FUTURE: Instead of the zip archive, we could also allow our submit box to accept a folder, which it copies, including all the directly enclosed files.]        ",

On each trial, the target is a randomly selected character from the fontCharacterSet displayed in the specified font.\n\n= repeatedLetter. Display many copies of two targets, alternating across the screen. The observer reports both. Thus each presentation gets two responses, which count as two trials. The two target letters alternate for as many lines as fit on the screen and within targetRepeatsMaxLines. The last character at both ends of each line is targetRepeatsBorderCharacter. Neighboring lines are complementary so that the nearest letter from one line to a neighboring line is the other target.  David Regan and colleagues (1992) reported that in testing foveal acuity of patients with poor fixation (e.g. nystagmus) it helps to have a "repeat-letter format" eye chart covered with letters of the same size, so that no matter where the eye lands, performance is determined by the letter nearest to the point of fixation, where acuity is best. We here extend that idea to crowding. We cover some part of the screen with an alternating pattern of two letters, like a checkerboard, so that the letters can crowd each other, and ask the observer to report both letters. Again, we expect performance to be determined by the letters nearest to the (unpredictable) point of fixation, where crowding distance is least. HORIZONTALLY, the two targets alternate, forming a line, and size and spacing are specified in the usual way. VERTICALLY. If there is more than one line, then the line spacing (baseline to baseline) is the product of spacingOverSizeRatio and the height of the bounding box of fontCharacterSet.\nIMPORTANT: Some fonts may require increased fontPadding higher than its default value in order to avoid clipping of the letters. Such a high padding may cause errors in target lateness and duration. EasyEyes reports targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec in the CSV file. \n\n= image.

The image aspect ratio is preserved. \n* If this condition includes one or more questionAndAnswers, they apply to this image. In that case one of the questionAndAnswers can be "identify" and the observer will be asked to identify the image by clicking one of several names. \n* One name is based on the target image\'s filename. The rest are foils, names based on randomly drawn (without replacement) image files in the targetImageFolder. The displayed name is the initial part of the image filename, not including the first period and the rest of the filename.\n* The number of trials is specified by conditionTrials, modified by thresholdPracticeUntilCorrectBool and thresholdAllowedTrialRatio.\n* Each targetKind=image trial uses HTML <image> to present the image with color management at given size, eccentricity, and duration: targetSizeDeg, targetSizeIsHeightBool, targetDurationSec, targetEccentricityXDeg, and targetEccentricityYDeg.\n* On each trial, ask all the questions: questionAndAnswer01, questionAndAnswer02, etc. Can be any number of questions. Each can be a rating, multiple choice, or free text.\n* Image identification task. The task shows the image briefly and the participant identifies its name in a menu of abbreviated filenames. Score each trial right/wrong. In displaying each filename as a choice, abbreviated by suppressing the first period whatever follows it. There can be more than one file with the same initial part. Duplicate initial parts are suppressed on the answer screen. For example, suppose you have four images: living.duck.jpg, living.elephant.jpg, inanimate.rock, inanimate.car. The initial parts, before period, suppressing duplicates, are ‚Äúliving‚Äù and ‚Äúinanimate‚Äù. EasyEyes will randomly show one of the four images, but the answer screen will offer only two choices: living and inanimate.

Uses specified font and writing direction (fontLeftToRightBool). readingXXX parameters specify corpus and starting point, control font size (usually via letter-to-letter spacing in deg), number of characters per line, and number of lines per page, and determine how many alternatives in each retention question and how many retention questions. The set of alternatives consists of a target word and foils that have approximately the same frequency in the corpus. IMPORTANT: conditionTrials is ignored when targetKind==reading. \n\n= rsvpReading. Flashes several words with Quest-controlled word duration. The parameter responseSpokenToExperimenterBool determines whether the trial\'s scoring is "spoken" (for children) or "silent" (for adults). In "silent" scoring, the participant sees a horizontal row of lines, each representing a shown word. Below each line is a list of possible words, including the correct one. The participant must select a word in each column to continue. readingXXX parameters specify how many alternatives for each word and how many retention questions. The set of alternatives consists of a target word and foils that have approximately the same frequency in the corpus.  In "spoken" scoring we assume that an experimenter sits next to the child participant, who reads the presented words aloud. Once the child has read the words aloud, the experimenter presses the SHIFT key to see the actual words, to guide scoring of what the child said. For each word, the experimenter presses either the up arrow for correct or down arrow for wrong. Supports fontLeftToRightBool for, e.g., Arabic.\n\n= vernier. Two vertical lines separated by a fixed vertical targetGapDeg and a variable horizontal targetOffsetDeg. \n* Vernier acuity measures how well people can judge the alignment of two vertical lines across a small gap.

Imagine drawing one line going up from that point and another going down. To create the stimulus, we move those imaginary line segments in opposite directions horizontally and vertically. Vertically the upper line goes up by targetGapDeg/2, and the bottom line goes down by targetGapDeg/2. Horizontally we move the upper line right or left, by targetOffsetDeg (which is controlled by Quest), and the lower line by the same distance in the opposite direction.

A sound is randomly drawn, without replacement (for this condition in this block) from a folder whose name is specified by targetSoundFolder. The target sound is played for its full duration at level targetSoundDBSPL with a masker sound randomly selected from the maskerSoundFolder played at level maskerDBSPL. Also, in the background, we play targetSoundNoise at level targetSoundNoiseDBSPL.\n\n= vocoderPhrase. The targetSoundFolder and maskerSoundFolder each contain a hierarchy of folders containing 16-channel sound files. Each sound file is named for a word and contains the original or processed sound of that word (except that the file called "GoTo.wav" in fact contains the two words "go to"). The top level of folders in targetSoundFolder and maskerSoundFolder are folders of sounds produced by several talkers. Currently the talkers (Talker11, Talker14, Talker16, and Talker18) are all female. On each trial the target and masker are randomly assigned different talkers (never equal). Within each talker\'s folder are several loose word files (Now.wav, GoTo.wav, and Ready.wav), and several category folders (CallSign, Color, Number) that each contain several word files. Each trial follows text phrases provided in the parameters targetSoundPhrase and maskerSoundPhrase. Each phrase consists of a series of explicit words and category names, with each category name preceded by #. Currently the targetSoundPhrase is "Ready Baron GoTo #Color #Number Now", and the maskerSoundPhrase is "Ready #CallSign GoTo #Color #Number Now". The target and masker phrases are played at the same time, aligning the temporal midpoint of both words in each target-masker pair by symmetrically padding both ends of the briefer word with zeroes to make it the same length as the longer word. Each explicit word in each script is played every time. On each trial, each word category, marked by #, is replaced by a randomly selected word from that category folder, except that target and masker are always different from each other when either is drawn from a category.  On each trial, the target and masker phrases are combined by randomly taking targetSoundChannels (default 9) of the 16 channels of every word in the target phrase, and the remaining 16-targetSoundChannels channels from the masker words. The channel selection is consistent for all the words in the phrase, and new for each trial. targetSoundDBSPL specifies the sound level of the combined targetSoundChannels channels taken from each target word. Similarly maskerSoundDBSPL specifies the sound level of the combined 16-targetSoundChannels channels taken from each masker word. Also, we play targetSoundNoise at level targetSoundNoiseDBSPL. The Zhang et al. (2021) paper mentions a noise control, in which the masker is white noise that has been filtered into 16 bands and windowed into word-length durations. The scientist achieves this simply by providing a maskerSoundFolder made up of these 16-channel noises, each derived from a word. \nRESPONSE. After playing the phrase, EasyEyes displays two columns, one for each category word in the targetSoundPhrase. The observer must select one word in each column in order to proceed to the next trial. (This is forced choice.) We score the trial as right only if both responses are right. That overall right/wrong response is provided to QUEST, which controls the targetSoundDBSPL.‚≠ë \n\n= gabor. A gabor is the product of a Gaussian and a sinewave. As a function of space, the sinewave produces a grating, and the Gaussain vignettes it to a specific area, without introducing edges.

The (wrong) trials are collected in the normal way, so Quest keeps making the task easier. Practice trials count towards the number of trials you request through conditionTrials. \n1. FLUSH AFTER FIRST CORRECT RESPONSE. After the participant's first correct response in this condition, EasyEyes flushes Quest for this condition, to start fresh, with the original prior probability density, and the original requested number of trials. In terms of coding, the main change is the flush after the first correct response. The practice trials will be reported, as usual, in the Results CSV file, but won't be included in Quest's non-practice staircase.\n2. BUT START AT THE LEVEL THAT SUCCEEDED. Some participants may need the easy stimulus of their successful practice trial. So, to get things off on the right foot, for the first trial on the record, Quest will provide the same levelSuggestedByQuest as it provided in the successful practice trial. For this first on-the-record trial, EasyEyes uses the saved value of levelSuggestedByQuest, instead of asking Quest to compute it.\n\nBACKGROUND. Getting the first trial wrong is a frequent problem in testing children, and occasionally in testing adults. Quest then makes the next trial bigger, and the staircase typically doesn't recover. Mathematically, Quest is doing the right thing, under the assumption that the observer is stationary. However, people often goof on the first trial, getting an easy trial wrong, and this uncharacteristic (non-stationary) behavior biases Quest to test very easy stimuli that are not optimal for estimating threshold. Marialuisa and I came up with a simple rule to solve this problem. We suppose that people only become stationary AFTER their first correct response. ",

  viewingDistanceAllowedRatio: {
    name: "viewingDistanceAllowedRatio",
    availability: "now",
    type: "numerical",
    default: "1.1",
    explanation:
      "viewingDistanceAllowedRatio (default 1.1) must be greater than or equal to zero and specifies a tolerance interval around the desired viewing distance D¬†=¬†viewingDistanceDesiredCm. If viewingDistanceAllowedRatio>1, then the allowed range of viewing distance is \nD/viewingDistanceAllowedRatio to D*viewingDistanceAllowedRatio. \nIf it's <1 then the allowed range of viewing distance is \nD*viewingDistanceAllowedRatio to D/viewingDistanceAllowedRatio. \nA value of 0 allows all viewing distances. Viewing distance is enforced by the \"nudger\", which is enabled if and only if you enable calibrateTrackDistanceBool=TRUE. The nudger pauses testing while viewing distance is outside the allowed range, and the participant is encouraged to move in or out, as appropriate, toward the desired viewing distance. We call that \"nudging\".  \n\nNote: CSV and Excel files do not allow INF.\n\nTHE NUDGER. The nudger is enabled if and only if you enable calibrateTrackDistanceBool=TRUE. When viewing distance is outside the allowed range, the nudger puts up a full-screen opaque display telling the participant to MOVE CLOSER or FARTHER, as appropriate. (This is translated to the appropriate language.) The nudge display goes away when the participant is again within the allowed range. In our experience, the viewing-distance nudger (\"Closer\", \"Farther\") quickly gets the participant to the right distance, and they soon learn to stay there so they see this display only a few times. \n     On any trial, before computing the stimulus, EasyEyes will get a fresh estimate of viewing distance, and, if the nudger is not satisfied, wait until it is. EasyEyes waits until the nudger is satisfied, i.e. the estimated viewing distance is in the allowed range specified by viewingDistanceDesiredCm and viewingDistanceAllowedRatio. Use viewingDistanceAllowedPreciseBool=TRUE to show distance with an extra digit after the decimal. That's handy when you're checking it's accuracy.\n     We protect the stimulus from nudging. The nudger will never occlude, or forward or backward mask, the stimulus. Think of the trial as beginning at the participant's request for the stimulus (by keypress or clicking or tracking the crosshair) and ending at the click (or keypress) response. This leaves a pre-trial interval from the response until the click requesting the next trial. EasyEyes nudges only before and between trials. Furthermore, to prevent forward masking, EasyEyes ignores attempts to click (or press a key) during nudging and until targetSafetyMarginSec after nudging. Accepted clicks (or keypresses) produce a click sound. Ignored attempts are silent.\n\nPRE-TRIAL INTERVAL. We allow nudging from the time of response to the previous trial (click or keypress) until the participant requests a new trial (press space bar or click or track crosshair). \n\nSTIMULUS & RESPONSE INTERVALS. The stimulus and its memory are protected by disabling nudging from the moment of the participant's request for a new trial until the observer responds. \n\nThe trial software sets the internal parameter nudgingAllowedBool to TRUE only during the pre-trial, and sets nudgingCancelsTrialBool to always be FALSE.  The scientist cannot directly control nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool.\n\nFUTURE ENHANCEMENT ONCE WE CAN CANCEL TRIALS. If we acquire the possibility of canceling a trial, then we could allow nudging during the stimulus interval, and immediately cancel that trial. Once a trial has been canceled we do NOT wait for a response. Instead, we proceed directly to draw the crosshair for the next trial. Canceling a trial is not trivial. We need to put this trial's condition back into the list of conditions to be run, and that list needs to be reshuffled, so the participant won't know what the next trial will be. I suppose that what happened will be obvious to the participant, so we don't need to explain that the trial was canceled. I see two stages of implementation. First the trial software needs to provide and update two flags: nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool. The current version of MultistairHandler doesn't cope with trial cancelation. For now, the trial software sets nudgingAllowedBool to TRUE only during the pre-trial interval, and sets nudgingCancelsTrialBool to always be FALSE. Once we know how to cancel a trial, during the stimulus interval we'll set both nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool to TRUE. ",

  viewingDistanceDesiredCm: {

    default: "50",
    explanation:
      '‚≠ë If viewingDistanceDesiredCm is nonzero (default 50), then it specifies the desired viewing distance. If head tracking is enabled (calibrateTrackDistance = "object" and/or "blindspot") then nudging will enforce the desired distance (see viewingDistanceAllowedRatio) and stimulus generation will be based on the actual viewing distance of each trial. Without head tracking, EasyEyes assumes that the viewing distance is viewingDistanceDesiredCm. [The EasyEyes compiler should require that all conditions within a block have the same desired viewing distance.]\n     "Viewing distance" is defined by viewingDistanceWhichEye and viewingDistanceWhichPoint.\n     The output CSV data file reports viewingDistanceCm. Typically, head tracking is enabled, so measured viewing distance changes over time, updated every frame, typically at 60 Hz.\n     Use viewingDistanceAllowedRatio to control nudging. Nudging is very handy. We find that, with nudging, observers quickly learn to stay in the allowed range, with hardly any perceived effort. \n     To check the accuracy of viewing distance tracking online, set calibrateDistanceCheckBool=TRUE. To check in your lab, set a tight tolerance viewingDistanceAllowedRatio=1.01. While outside the allowed range the nudger provides a live report of measured viewing distance, which you can check with your tape measure. Use viewingDistanceAllowedPreciseBool=TRUE to show distance with an extra decimal digit.\n',

    explanation:
      'üïë viewMonitorsXYDeg x1, y1;  x2, y2; x3, y3 accepts one or more xy coordinates, one per monitor, each of which specifies an xy eccentricity in deg. The default is no eccentricities, which disables this parameter. The block will be skipped, and an error flagged, if the computer does not have enough monitors.. It\'s ok to have more monitors than needed.\n     EasyEyes will suppose that the scientist probably, but not necessarily, wants the first eccentricity on the main monitor, e.g. the screen that the EasyEyes window first opens on. As a web app, I think that EasyEyes cannot directly measure how many monitors are available. It will display several small windows on the main screen, which each ask to be dragged to the appropriate monitor, e.g. "Drag me to the left monitor." or "Drag me to the middle monitor." or "Drag me to the right monitor.".\n     When using viewMonitorsXYDeg, we will typically have three monitors, and we‚Äôll request three eccentricities. For example:\nviewMonitorsXYDeg 0, 0; -60, 0; 60, 0\nor\nviewMonitorsXYDeg 0, 0; 0, -60; 0, 60\nThe first example is for testing the horizontal meridian; the second is for the vertical meridian. Each request asks EasyEyes to place three monitors, one for each eccentricity, with the monitor‚Äôs screen orthogonal to the observer‚Äôs line of sight (from the nearer eye) at the specified eccentricity. The eye\'s perpendicular "foot" is the point in the plane of the screen where the nearer eye\'s sight line is orthogonal to the flat screen. We refer to it as the screen‚Äôs foot.  The monitor should be placed so that the foot is at the specified viewingDistanceDesiredCm and eccentricity, and as near as possible to the screen center, while avoiding monitor collisions.\n     When viewMonitorsXYDeg provides N eccentricities, demanding N monitors. EasyEyes needs to know the size (width and height) and margins of each monitor. The first time, it will display N little windows on the main screen and ask the participant to drag each window to the monitor it belongs on. Then it will ask the participant to measure (in cm) and type in the each screen\'s width, height, and margins. It will save this, so for subsequent blocks of the same experiment there is minimal fuss.\n\nARGUMENT PARSING, CHECKED BY COMPILER: There can be zero or more xy coordinates, separated by semicolons. Each coordinate consists of two comma-separated numbers. Each number must be in the range ¬±180 deg. The tokens are numbers, commas, and semicolns. Spaces between tokens are ignored. So are leading and trailing spaces. Missing numbers are a fatal error. \n\nFUTURE: We plan to add general support for vectors and matrices. Syntax will be like MATLAB in using commas to separate elements in a row, and semicolons to separate rows. Thus viewMonitorsXYDeg will accept a 2√óN matrix. with 2 elements per row, and any number of rows.',
