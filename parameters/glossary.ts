    explanation:
      '🕑 _calibrateMicrophoneKeywords (see defaults below) is a list of keywords used to interpret the list of input devices returned by Web Audio on a mobile phone. On a desktop, Web Audio identifies which input device is in use. On a mobile device, Web Audio just gives a list of available input devices, which may include use of the loudspeaker as a microphone. For calibration purposes, EasyEyes assumes that the phone is using either its main built-in microphone or a connected external microphone. When connected to a smartphone by the QR-code technique, EasyEyes scans the enumerated list of sound input device "labels" returned by web audio. Any enumerated device whose label includes a keyword from the _calibrateMicrophoneKeywords list will be assumed to be the active external microphone, and that name will be reported as the web audio name of the Microphone. Keyword matching ignores case. If no label matches a keyword, then EasyEyes assumes that the microphone enumerated as "mics:0" is default and active, and returns its name, which on some phones is "Default". If any of your participants uses an external microphone that EasyEyes fails to detect, you may be able help EasyEyes to catch it by adding a keyword to the default list and using that extended list. Conversely, if our list inadvertently contains a keyword that is causing a false alarm because it appears in a participant\'s phone\'s label for an internal sound-input source, you can create and use a new list without the problematic keyword.\nDEFAULT (matching ignores case): "Mik-1, Mik-2, Bluetooth, Headset, Headphones, Wireless, On-Ear, Over-Ear, In-Ear, Buds, Earbuds, AirPods, Eardrops, Air, Cloud, MIDI, Line-in, Audeze, Audio-Technica, Blackwire, Beats, beyerdynamic, Blue Satellite, BlueParrot, Bowers & Wilkins, Caymuller, Bose, Conambo, COOSII, Cowin, Discover, Focal, HD, HEIBAS, HIFIMAN, HyperX, Jabra, JBL, Koss, LEVN, Logitech, Meze, Monolith, NANAMI, Poly, Porta, Raycon, Sennheiser, Shure, Sony, Soundcore, TOZO, Trucker, Vibe, Voyager, Yealink"',

    explanation:
      "_calibrateMicrophonesBool (default FALSE) enables calibration of new microphones, typically smartphone microphones. This is intended solely for use by a few sound experts (for now, Denis Pelli and his assistants), and requires a calibrated microphone (especially the manufacturer-calibrated USB miniDSP UMIK-1, available from miniDSP for $79) for the initial loudspeaker calibration. First, the calibrated mic is used to calibrate the loudspeaker, then the calibrated loudspeaker is used to calibrate, one by one, any number of microphones. Each new calibration file is added to the EasyEyes microphone calibration library. To contribute a microphone profile to the EasyEyes profile library, the scientist must provide _authorEmails.  ",

      "❌🕑 _calibrateMicrophonesOnlyViaPhoneBool (default TRUE) allows microphone calibration only via a smartphone connected by QR code. This prevents a local connection (internal mic., USB mic., bluetooth mic. or Apple handoff), which, at least on a MacBook Pro, goes though the OS sound panel which often screws up efforts to calibrate sound. This is intended solely for use by scientists. We have been unable to get useful recording through a local connection, which all go through the Sound panel. It appears that despite our attempts to disable echoCancellation, noiseSuppression, and autoGainControl, the OS removes the calibration sounds, played through the loudspeaker, from the recording, which ruins the calibration. We were unabel to fix this, but we seem to get good recordings through a smartphone recruited through a QR code, so we're moving forward with that workaround. To use a calibrated mic (e.g. UMIK-1 from miniDSP) we attach it directly to the smartphone. We protect the scientist from bad calibration by disabling local connection by default. However, if you really want that, just set _calibrateMicrophonesOnlyViaPhoneBool=FALSE and you'll be allowed to record locally.",

  _calibrateScreenSizeCookieBool: {

      "🕑 _calibrateScreenSizeCookieBool (default TRUE) when TRUE enables EasyEyes reading and saving of a cookie (on the participant computer) containing the screen resolution (px) and size (cm),  e.g. 3024 px x 1964 px, 24.5 cm x 16 cm. The cookie is read only if it's present and calibrateScreenSizeCookieBool==TRUE. If read, the cookie is considered valid only if it reports a screen resolution (width x height px) that matches the current resolution. If valid then EasyEyes takes the screen size (width x height cm) from the cookie instead of doing the calibration normally provoked by calibrateScreenSizeBool==TRUE. Lacking a valid cookie, then calibrateScreenSizeBool==TRUE will provoke size calibration. If size is actually calibrated, and calibrateScreenSizeCookieBool==TRUE, then a cookie is saved, holding the screen resolution and size. The reason to check for validity is that the computer might have several screens, and the browser window could be opened on any of them. The chances are low that a given computer will have two screens with different sizes and the same resolution. Set calibrateScreenSizeCookieBool=FALSE to rule out the small chance of mistaking a new display for a same-resolution but differently sized one that was calibrated on a previous occasion.",

To be useful, it should be longer than the impulse response that you want to measure. Excess length improves the signal to noise ratio.

There will be _calibrateSoundBurstsWarmup+_calibrateSoundBurstRepeats sound bursts, and only the final _calibrateSoundBurstRepeats are recorded and analyzed. Having a warmup burst is traditional among professionals who use MLS to measure concert halls. It's meant to give the loudspeaker and microphone time to reach a stationary state before recording for analysis. It is common to set this to 1 (for very accurate measurement) or 0 (to save time). We can't think of any reason to use another value.",

    explanation:
      "🕑 _compileAsNewExperimentBool (default TRUE) can be set to FALSE to accommodate users without an institutional Pavlovia license. Without that license, Pavlovia requires assigning tokens (money) to each experiment before it can run in RUNNING mode. If _compileAsNewExperimentBool=TRUE (the default), then, when EasyEyes compiles your experiment, EasyEyes appends the smallest possible integer (at least 1) to the spreadsheet filename (without extension) to create a unique (unused) experiment name. That keeps versions apart, and keeps the data from each version in its own repository. However, for users without a site license, Pavlovia requires that tokens be assigned in advance to the specific experiment (repo). For them, every time EasyEyes changes the repo name, they must visit Pavlovia to assign tokens to the new repo, which can be a nuisance. Token users (i.e. without a site license) can minimize the token-assignment nuisance by setting _compileAsNewExperimentBool=FALSE to reuse the old repo, instead of creating a new repo every time they compile. The downside is that if you collect data, edit the table, and collect more data, the data files will all be together in the same repo, distinguished only by date. When _compileAsNewExperimentBool is FALSE, scientists only need to assign tokens the first time they compile (when it's a new repo). Once it has tokens, provided the name of the spreadsheet file is unchanged, they can keep testing, through countless compiles, without visiting Pavlovia, until the experiment runs out of tokens. Note that this flag doesn't affect PILOTING mode, which is always free and can only be used from within Pavlovia. Also, any users concerned over the huge proliferation of repos might like to set _compileAsNewExperimentBool FALSE to minimize the number of repos created by EasyEyes.\nSee _pavloviaPreferRUNNINGModeBool for a more advice on working without an institutional Pavlovia site license.",

EasyEyes measures lateness and duration and reports them as targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec in the CSV file. We find that setting _needProcessorCoresMinimum=6 nearly eliminated bad timing, but it also eliminates quite a few computers with good timing. You may prefer to set _needProcessorCoresMinimum lower, e.g. 4, to include most computers, and weed out the slow computers later, during data analysis, based on mean and SD of  targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec. \nNOTE: To make your computer harder to track, the Chrome extension DuckDuckGo spoofs the number of cores to 2.

      "_pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool helps EasyEyes optimize its behavior by indicating your preference for use of RUNNING or PILOTING mode while testing. Pavlovia offers two modes (RUNNING and PILOTING) for running your study. Remote data collection requires RUNNING mode. PILOTING mode is meant for checking and debugging and runs only from the Pavlovia console on the scientist's computer. The only advantage of the PILOTING mode is that it's always free. Unless your institution has a Pavlovia site license, RUNNING mode costs 20 pence per participant, and requires assigning tokens (money) in advance to each experiment. (Setting _compileAsNewExperiment=FALSE allows you to request that EasyEyes keep reusing the same experiment name, as you compile new versions, so you can assign tokens once to the experiment, when you begin testing, instead of before each compile.) Thus scientists with a site license will always prefer RUNNING mode. Without that license, scientists can save money by using PILOTING mode during development, and switch to RUNNING mode to test remote participants. _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool allows you to express your preference. With an institutional site license, you'll always want the default TRUE. Without an institutional site license, you can save money by setting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool=FALSE during development, and TRUE for the actual remote testing. Without a site license, if you don't mind the 20 p expense, you can use RUNNING mode throughout (use the default _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool=TRUE), and set _compileAsNewExperiment=FALSE to minimize the frequency at which you must assign tokens to the experiment.\n\nOLD EXPLANATION. Setting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool TRUE (the default) streamlines the use of Pavlovia's RUNNING mode, and setting it FALSE streamlines the use of Pavlovia's PILOTING mode. _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool helps EasyEyes anticipate your preference in optimizing the EasyEyes user interface. EasyEyes uses a Pavlovia repository to hold your experiment. Pavlovia offers two modes for running your experiment, PILOTING and RUNNING. PILOTING mode is free, but can only be run directly from the Pavlovia dashboard, which prevents remote testing. RUNNING mode costs 20 pence per participant (this fee is waived if your instititution has a site license), and you get a URL for your study that you can send to your online participants. It is our guess that most EasyEyes users (like current Pavlovia users) will belong to institutions with Pavlovia site licenses, and thus have no usage fee. Thus, for most users, we suggest letting _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool be TRUE (the default) to streamline the EasyEyes scientist page for RUNNING mode. When _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool is TRUE, you just submit your table to the EasyEyes compiler to receive your study URL, with no more clicks. That includes setting your experiment to RUNNING mode in Pavlovia. If _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool is FALSE, then your experiment remains in the INACTIVE mode, waiting for you to click the \"Go to Pavlovia\" button, where you'll use the Pavlovia dashboard to set your experiment to PILOTING mode and run it. (Pavlovia has no API by which EasyEyes could do this for you.) If your experiment is already in RUNNING mode you can still switch to PILOTING mode. Thus _pavloviaPreferRunningModeBool doesn't close any doors; it just streamlines use of your usually preferred mode.",

    availability: "now",

    default: "",
    explanation:
      "⭑ _prolific1ProjectID. To use Prolific with EasyEyes, you must figure out whether your Prolific account is in the new (since mid-2022) \"Workspace\" mode or it's older non-Workspace mode (which may become obsolete). \nhttps://researcher-help.prolific.co/hc/en-gb/articles/4500057146140-Workspaces-\nBefore Prolific's Workspace mode arrived, there was no Project ID. In Workspace mode you assign funds to a folder which has a name and a project ID (a roughly 24-digit hexadecimal number). You can have multiple studies in one project folder; they all share the same project ID. If your experiment table includes an _prolific1ProjectID number, then EasyEyes will use it and call Prolific in Workspace mode. If _prolific1ProjectID is empty or absent, then EasyEyes will call Prolific in pre-Workspace mode.  If you provide a wrong Project ID then you'll get an invalid address (404) when EasyEyes tries to access your Prolific workspace. EasyEyes assumes that Prolific is locked into one mode or the other. (In fact, Prolific allows you to upgrade your Prolific account from pre-Workspace into Workspace mode, but you cannot downgrade, which is fine since Workspace mode is better.) If EasyEyes calls Prolific in the wrong mode, the call fails to transfer vital information for your study, which you'll notice when you try to publish your study in Prolific. Currently EasyEyes can't tell which mode your Prolific account is in, and expects you to provide a _prolific1ProjectID if and only if Prolific is in Workspace mode. So if you arrive in Prolific, and find Prolific ignorant of your study, you probably guessed wrong about the mode of your Prolific account. Does your study in Prolific have a Prolific Project ID? If yes, then your Prolific account is in Workspace mode, otherwise not. You can run all studies with the same _prolific1ProjectID, or have several projects eash with their own _prolific1ProjectID.",

The extra saves enabled by _saveEachBlockBool are in addition to the always-performed saves at the beginning and "end" of the session.

All saves are alike in saving all currently known rows and parameters to the CSV file, and all saves are cumulative, only adding new data. The CSV file on Pavlovia is readable throughout, and grows in length with successive saves. EasyEyes first saves after the compatibility check, before the remote calibration (regardless of whether the remote calibrator runs), which is before the first block, and again at the "end," which includes four cases: 1. completion, 2. orderly termination through an error message or the escape mechanism including waiting out the "saving" window at the end, 3. closing the EasyEyes window before completion or termination, and 4. shift of browser focus away from the EasyEyes page before completion or termination. Saving does not end the experiment.  After shifting attention away, the participant can shift attention back to EasyEyes and continue the experiment, which will save again in any of the four ways.

After the size and/or distance calibration, if calibrationDistanceCheckBool is TRUE, then we will ask the participant if they have an appropriate measuring device (ideally a tape measure, meter stick, or yard stick; a 12" or 30 cm ruler could be used if we exclude long distances), and, if so, how long is it, and what are its units: decimal cm, decimal inches, fractional inches. If no device, then we skip the rest of the calibrations that need a measuring device. In our instructions, we can say "Use your ruler, stick, or tape to measure this." When receiving fractional inches we could either accept a string like "16 3/16" or we could have three fields that each accept an integer, and allow the user to tab from field to field: "?? ??/??". The last number must be 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. For round numbers, the numerator will be zero. After measuring screen size, we can ask them to use their ruler, stick, or tape to measure screen width. We can display a huge double headed arrow from left edge to right edge. After measuring viewing distance we can ask them to use ruler, stick, or tape to create three exact viewing distances that we then use the webcam to measure. We can request 12, 24, or 36 inches, or 30, 60, or 90 cm. (These are round numbers, not exactly equivalent.) \n     We have two ways of measuring viewing distance and I’d like to evaluate both. Our current scheme with the calibrator is to have a Boolean parameter for each calibration. We should have separate parameters for the two methods of measuring viewing distance so scientists can select none, either, or both. It would be interesting to compare the two estimates (direct vs indirect) of pupillary distance. We should always save the pupillary distance with the data. We can compare our population distribution with the textbook distribution. It might be an elegant check on our biometrics. \n     We could test people on Prolific and mention in our job description that they must have a tape measure, meter stick, or yard stick.  Readers of our article will like seeing data from 100 people online plus 10 experienced in-house participants. I think this will create confidence in the calibrations. For scientists that’s crucial.\n',

Set the new CSV output parameter calibrationRulerBool (default empty) to TRUE or FALSE indicating whether a suitable measuring device is available. If FALSE, then EasyEyes will skip all tests that require a measuring device. In our instructions, we can say "Use your ruler, stick, or tape to measure this."

After measuring viewing distance we can ask them to use ruler, stick, or tape to create three exact viewing distances that we then use the webcam to measure.

We should have separate parameters for the two methods of measuring viewing distance so scientists can select none, either, or both.

We can compare our population distribution with the textbook distribution.

(The list of allowed font types is copied from the Mozilla documentation of the @font-face command. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face)\n\ngoogle:  font is the filename (without extension) of a font file provided by the free Google Font server. \n\n🕑 COMING SOON: server: font is a URL pointing to the desired font on a font server. For example, many fonts are served for free by the Google Fonts server.  https://fonts.google.com/  At that website, use "Search for font". Having found your font, select the style you want. In the "Selected Family" pop-up window, click the "@import" button. From within the revealed CSS code, copy the URL from inside the "url(. )". \n\nbrowser: The experiment will pass the font preference string that you place in font to the participant\'s browser and accept whatever the browser provides.  Your string can include several font names, separated by commas, first choice first, to help the browser find something close to your intent. This is the usual way to select a font on the web, and never generates an error.  Specify just the family name, like "Verdana", and use the "fontStyle" to select italic, bold, or bold-italic. Some "web safe" fonts (e.g. Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, Courier New, Brush Script MT) are available in most browsers. In ordinary browsing, it\'s helpful that browsers freely substitute fonts so that you almost always get something readable in the web page you\'re reading. In the scientific study of perception, we usually don\'t want data with a substituted font. So, normally, you should specify "file" or "server" so you\'ll know exactly what was shown to the participant. \n\nEasyEyes preloads all fonts. At the beginning of the experimen, EasyEyes preloads all needed fonts, for the whole experiment (all conditions), so, after preload, the experiment runs with no font-loading delay and no need for internet, except to save data at the end.

The second row is languageNameEnglish, with values: English, German, Polish, etc. The third row is languageNameNative, with values: English, Deutsch, Polskie, etc. \n     We incorporate the latest "EasyEyes International Phrases" file when we compile threshold.js. For a particular experiment, we only need the first column (the mnemonic name) and the column whose heading matches instructionLanguage. We should copy those two columns into a Javascript dictionary, so we can easily look up each mnemonic phrase name to get the phrase in the instructionLanguage. To display any instruction, we will use the dictionary to convert a mnemonic name to a unicode phrase. \n     languageDirection. Note that most languages are left to right (LTR), and a few (e.g. Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, and Hebrew) are right to left (RTL). Text placement may need to take the direction into account. The direction (LTR or RTL) is provided by the languageDirection field.\n     languageNameNative. If we later allow the participant to choose the language, then the language selection should be based on the native language name, like Deustch or Polskie, i.e. using languageNameNative instead of languageNameEnglish.',

(Tip: one easy way to stably measure from a laptop screen is to lay the screen on its back and rest the photocell, gently, directly on the screen.) Use measureLuminanceHz and measureLuminanceDelaySec to set the sampling rate and start time from stimulus onset. After sampling the stimulus, EasyEyes saves a data file called luminances-EXPERIMENT-BLOCK-NAME-TRIAL.csv into the Downloads folder, where EXPERIMENT is the experiment name, BLOCK is the block number, NAME is the conditionName, and TRIAL is the trial number. The first column is the time stamp (in fractional seconds), since the stimulus onset, of the luminance measurement. The second column is copied from movieValues. The third column is measured luminance in cd/m^2 (candelas per meter squared, also called nits). Note that measureLuminanceDelaySec can be negative, so the time stamp too can be negative.

  movieComputeJS: {

    explanation:
      '⭑ movieComputeJS holds the filename (including extension “.js”) of a JavaScript program to compute an HDR movie. A one-frame movie will display a static image for the specified targetDurationSec. movieComputeJS is used if and only if the targetKind is movie. When the experiment is compiled, the movie program must already have been uploaded through the EasyEyes submission box. The program must define and fill the “movieNit” array. The program can use several predefined variables, including: movieRectPx, tSec, xyDeg, xDeg, and yDeg, as well as the EasyEyes input parameters targetContrast, targetEccentricityXDeg, targetEccentricityYDeg, targetCyclePerDeg, targetHz, targetPhaseDeg, targetOrientationDeg (clockwise from vertical), targetSpaceConstantDeg (the 1/e radius), targetTimeConstantSec, movieRectDeg, and movieLuminanceNit. When EasyEyes reads your compute js file, it processes the list of argument in the function definition. You can include any of the INPUT PARAMETERS defined in this GLOSSARY in your list of arguments. At runtime, EasyEyes will retrieve their values and provide whichever input parameters the argument list specifies.\n\nTIMING: Each movie trial reports timing data in the CSV results file. Each movie trial, computes a movie by first running the scientist\'s movieComputeJS and then passing it through the ffMPEG encoder. Here are some results using tiltedFlickeringGrating.js on Chrome on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020), asking ffMPEG to use the avc1 : libx264 codec. Total prep time (watching the wait icon) grows linearly with the product of pixels per frame and number of frames. \ntimeSec = 1 + MPix*frames/4\nwhere timeSec is the prep time in seconds, MPix means a mega pixel, i.e. one million pixels, and frames is the number of frames in the movie. 25% of this is the runtime of the tiltedFlickeringGrating.js, and 75% is ffMPEG. The formula for just ffMPEG is\nffMpegSec = 0.7 + MPix*frames/6\nThe 6 MPix/s rate seems fine. The fixed 0.7 s overhead is surprising. We don\'t yet know what it\'s doing during that time.\n\nTIMING DATA IN CSV FILE, for each trial\ncomputeMovieArraySec, e.g. 1.1. The time (in sec) spent in the scientist’s movie.js to prepare compute the movie for this trial.\ncomputeFfmpegSec, e.g. 2.1, The time (in sec) spent in ffMPEG to encode the movie for this trial\ncomputeTotalSec, e.g. 3.2, Total time (in sec) preparing the movie for this trial.\ncomputePixels, e.g., 1000000, The number of pixels in each frame.\ncomputeFrames, e.g. 10, The number of frames in the movie.\ncomputeCodec is the name is of the codec, different for Chrome and Safari.\n\n(NOT UP TO DATE) ADVICE ON HOW TO WRITE YOUR JavaScript MOVIE ROUTINE\nxyDeg is a 2*width*height float array, which provides the exact x,y visual coordinate of each screen pixel in movieRectPx. \nxDeg and yDeg are float vectors, which provide approximate visual coordinates of the screen pixels in movieRectPx. \nTo compute a (possibly one-frame) movie as a visual stimulus, we usually need the visual coordinate of each pixel. EasyEyes provides the width*height*2 array xyDeg[i,j,k], where each 2-number element (indexed by k) is the x,y position in deg of pixel i,j. Use of the xyDeg array does not allow speed up by computational separation of x and y, so you may prefer to use the separable approximation provided by the width-long vector xDeg and height-long vector yDeg, which provide approximate visual coordinates of the pixels in movieRectPx. (Note: xyDeg takes time and space for EasyEyes to compute, and not all movieComputeJS programs need it, so EasyEyes skips making xyDeg if the string  "xyDeg" is not found in the movieComputeJS file.)\n\nEXAMPLE: movieComputeJS might contain the filename "VerticalGrating.js", and that file might contain:\n// Compute vertical Gabor.\nvar imageNit = new Array(xDeg.length).fill(0)\n        .map(() => new Array(yDeg.length).fill(0));\nvar gx = [];\nvar gy = [];\nfor (const x of xDeg) {\n        gx.push(\n                Math.exp(-((x-targetEccentrictyXDeg)/targetSpaceConstantDeg)**2)\n        );\n}\nfor (const y of yDeg) {\n        gy.push(\n                Math.exp(-((y-targetEccentrictyYDeg)/targetSpaceConstantDeg)**2)\n        );\n}\nvar fx = [];\nfor (i = 0; i < xDeg.length; i++) {\n        fx[i]=gx[i]*Math.sin(\n                2*Math.PI*((xDeg[i]-targetEccentrictyXDeg)*targetCyclePerDeg + targetPhase/360)\n        )\n}\nfor (j = 0; j < yDeg.length; j++) {\n        for (i = 0; i < xDeg.length; i++) {\n                imageNit[i][j] = (255/2) * (1 + targetContrast * gy[j] * fx[i]);\n        }\n}',

It consists of four float numbers separated by commas, stored as text. All number are in deg relative to fixation. deg are positive above and to the right of fixation. The sequence is left,bottom,right,top. Whatever is requested will be mapped to pixels and clipped by screenRectPx. \n     Note that movieRectDeg is a rect on the retina, which will be curved on the screen, and tthe movie's screen pixels are specified as the screen rect, movieRectDeg. Guided by movieRectPxContainsRectDegBool, EasyEyes creates screenRectPx to be a reasonable approximation to movieRectDeg.\n     The scientist provides movieRectDeg, which defines a rect in visual coordinates (i.e. deg on the retina). Note that straight lines in visual space generally correspond to curves in pixel space. However, the HDR movie must be a screen rect (horizontal & vertical rectangle), so EasyEyes defines the movieRectPx screen rect approximation to movieRectDeg. movieRectDeg is rectangular on the retina, and movieRectPx is rectangular on the screen. \n     movieRectPx is the screen rect used for the movie. It is derived from movieRectDeg according to movieRectPxContainsDegBool, and then clipped by screenRectPx. If movieRectDeg is empty (the default) then movieRectPx is the whole screen, ie screenRectPx.\n     The movie bounds are movieRectPx. To compute a movie, we usually need to know the visual coordinate of each pixel.

If it's TRUE then movieRectPx is the screen bounding box containing the four midpoints and the four corners of movieRectDeg. So movieRectPx will contain practically all the pixels in movieRectDeg. The issue, of course, is that a rect on the screen (px coordinates) when mapped to the retina (deg coordinates) is not a rect, all four sides are curved. Similarly, a rect on the retina (deg coordinates) when mapped to the screen (px coordinates) is not a rect, all four sides are curved. Despite the imprerfect correspondence, rects are convenient, so movieRectPxContainsRectDegBool selects how to approximate the correspondence.

      "needEasyEyesKeypadBeyondCm (default 60). If any block has \nviewingDistanceDesiredCm > needEasyEyesKeypadBeyondCm, \nEasyEyes will recruit the participant's smartphone (at the beginning of the experiment) and provide a keypad on the smartphone during each block that requires it. The phone is recruited at the beginning of the experiment (on the compatibility page), and remains connected until the end of the experiment. The keypad is enabled only for blocks with a viewingDistanceDesiredCm that exceeds needEasyEyesKeypadBeyondCm. While the keypad is enabled, the participant is free to type on either or both the computer's keyboard and the smartphone keypad. Set needEasyEyesKeypadBeyondCm to zero to enable the keypad regardless of viewingDistanceDesiredCm. Set it to a huge value to never provide a keypad.\n\nCurrently we recruit the phone at the beginning of the first block that needs it. Let's change that to recruit the phone at the beginning of the experiment, on the compatibility page. If we can't recruit it, there's no point in running the experiment. \n\nI don't know if we disconnect at the end of the block, or the end of the last block that needs it, or just leave it connected until the end of the experiment. I think I prefer disconnecting after the last block that needs it. Some experiments will use the smartphone both as keypad AND for sound calibration. Sound calibration is done before the first block, so it will always come first. Requiring separate recruitment for each use is tolerable, but it would be nicer if participant could just recruit the smartphone once for the whole experiment. \n\nDELETE SOON: Currently we must ALSO set wirelessKeyboardNeededBool=TRUE in order for EasyEyes to establich connection with the keypad.\n\nGus April 14, 2023: Needed improvements that I already know:\n1. Support arbitrary fonts\n2. Make sure it works with targetKinds other than “letter”\n3. Add a visual indication on the keypad when responses aren’t being registered (currently we are ignoring responses from the threshold.js side when they aren’t allowed) \n4. Display a message when the keypad is no longer needed and the participant can put their phone away.\n\nDenis's requests:\n1. The smartphone connection should be established at the beginning of the experiment, before the calibrations, and nudging should be suspended until the smartphone is connected.\n2. When connection is first established, the smartphone's keypad is overwritten by a instructions which makes it hard to read both instructions and keypad.

Setting this parameter greater than zero in any condition of the whole experiment results in a minimum screen-width px compatibility requirement before the experiment begins.\n\nCompute required resolution for compatibility. EasyEyes ignores any conditions disabled by the scientist having set conditionEnabledBool FALSE. Similarly EasyEyes ignores any block disabled by virtue of having all its conditions disabled. EasyEyes combines pixel density (px/deg) and screen subtense (deg) across enabled conditions within each block. Then it computes required screen resolution (px) for each block, and computes the max across enabled blocks to arrive at the width and height pix requirements for the experiment. These requirements are declared on the EasyEyes Compatibility page when a participant computer is rejected.\n\nEasyEyes allows viewing distance to change from block to block, but makes it equal among all conditions within any block. The compatibility computation is performed first, before screen size (cm) is known, and viewing distance is typically set larger for a larger screen (cm) to achieve both the desired visual subtense (deg) and pixel density (px/deg). Thus, EasyEyes makes the compatibility calculations without knowing the viewing distance.\n\nTo compute required screen resolution (px), EasyEyes uses, from the experiment, one logical parameter conditionEnabledBool and four numerical parameters: targetMinimumPx, needTargetSizeDownToDeg, needScreenWidthUpToDeg, and needScreenHeightUpToDeg. For each block, EasyEyes first computes max of the required pixel density px/deg across enabled conditions:\nminPxPerDeg = max(targetMinimumPx/needTargetSizeDownToDeg) across enabled conditions in the block. Then it computes max of the required screen subtense (deg) across enabled conditions in each block:\nminScreenWidthDeg=max(needScreenWidthUpToDeg)\nand\nminScreenHeightDeg=max(needScreenHeightUpToDeg)\nFrom these three variables, for each block, EasyEyes computes the min screen resolution (px), for each block:\nminScreenWidthPx=minPxPerDeg*tand(minScreenWidthDeg/2)/tand(0.5)\nminScreenHeightPx=minPxPerDeg*tand(minScreenHeightDeg/2)/tand(0.5)\nwhere tand is a tangent function that accepts its argument in deg, i.e. tand(x)=tan(x*pi/180).\nFinally the required resolution for the experiment is the max required resolution max(minScreenWidthPx) and max(minScreenHeightPx) across all enabled blocks.\n\nThe TestScreenResolution.xlsx spreadsheet emulates the EasyEye Compatibility-Page computation of required screen resolution (px).",

(\"Without replacement\" considers all the trials of this condition of this block. Other conditions and blocks are independent.) The folder is submitted as a zip archive to the EasyEyes drop box, and saved in the EasyEyesResources repository of the scientist's Pavlovia account. To be clear: The scientist creates a suitably named folder full of images, and zips that; the zip archive inherits the name of the folder. Each file in the folder must have one of the allowed image-file extensions. Different files can have different extensions. No subfolders are allowed. An experiment uses the folder by setting targetImageFolder to the name of the zip archive, without the extension.\n\nEach image with embedded icc color profile will be color managed. 10-bit rendering and HDR are automatic, but require use of 16-bit png or jpeg2000. Parameters allow the scientist to specify eccentricity, size, and duration. When the images have diverse size the scientist can instead specify image pixels per degree. \nCOLOR MANAGEMENT. The browser's color-managed rendering will take into account the ICC color profiles of the image and display. For accurate image rendering, each image should have an embedded ICC color profile. (The informal convention of assuming an sRGB profile when none is embedded seems too unreliable, across browsers, for research-grade stimuli.) \n\nHDR. A large proportion of computer displays produced in recent years support 10 bits per color channel, and most browsers now use the 10 bits when displaying HDR (High dynamic range) images using the HTML <img> tag. Several Netflix engineers studied how to achieve 10-bit display on current browsers using available image formats. \nhttps://netflixtechblog.com/enhancing-the-netflix-ui-experience-with-hdr-1e7506ad3e8\nThey recommend using 16-bit PNG or JPEG 2000. 16-bit PNG is supported by the several browsers we tested. As of September 2022, Safari was the only browser supporting JPEG 2000.\nhttps://caniuse.com/jpeg2000\nSurprisingly, another web page claims that JPEG2000 is also supported by Chrome and Firefox.\nhttps://fileinfo.com/extension/jp2\n\n[FUTURE: Instead of the zip archive, we could also allow our submit box to accept a folder, which it copies, including all the directly enclosed files.]",

    explanation:
      '⭑ targetKind (default letter) specifies the kind of target.\n• letter On each trial, the target is a randomly selected character from the fontCharacterSet displayed in the specified font.\n• repeatedLetter. Display many copies of two targets, alternating across the screen. The observer reports both. Thus each presentation gets two responses, which count as two trials. The two target letters alternate for as many lines as fit on the screen and within targetRepeatedMaxLines. The last character at both ends of each line is targetRepeatsBorderCharacter. Neighboring lines are complementary so that the nearest letter from one line to a neighboring line is the other target.  David Regan and colleagues (1992) reported that in testing foveal acuity of patients with poor fixation (e.g. nystagmus) it helps to have a "repeat-letter format" eye chart covered with letters of the same size, so that no matter where the eye lands, performance is determined by the letter nearest to the point of fixation, where acuity is best. We here extend that idea to crowding. We cover some part of the screen with an alternating pattern of two letters, like a checkerboard, so that the letters can crowd each other, and ask the observer to report both letters. Again, we expect performance to be determined by the letters nearest to the (unpredictable) point of fixation, where crowding distance is least. HORIZONTALLY, the two targets alternate, forming a line, and size and spacing are specified in the usual way. VERTICALLY. If there is more than one line, then the line spacing (baseline to baseline) is the product of spacingOverSizeRatio and the height of the bounding box of fontCharacterSet.\nIMPORTANT: As of February, 2021, we need to set fontPadding=4 (very high) in order to avoid clipping of the letters when we use the Pelli font. Such a high padding may cause errors in target latency and duration. EasyEyes reports targetMeasuredLatenessSec and targetMeasuredDurationSec in the CSV file. Such errors typically matter only when targetDurationSec is a fraction of a second.\n• vernier Two vertical lines separated by a fixed vertical targetGapDeg and a variable horizontal targetOffsetDeg.\n• gabor A gabor is the product of a Gaussian and a sinewave. As a function of space, the sinewave produces a grating, and the Gaussain vignettes it to a specific area, without introducing edges. Gabors are a popular stimulus in vision research because they have compact frequency and location.\n• image An image is randomly drawn, without replacement (for this condition in this block) from a folder whose name is specified by targetImageFolder. The image is displayed at the target eccentricity with the target size. The image aspect ratio is preserved.\n• movie EasyEyes uses javascript movieComputeJS, provided by the scientist to compute an HDR movie, newly generated for each trial, and allows targetTask to be identify or detect.\n• reading Measure reading speed and retention. Uses specified font and writing direction (fontLeftToRightBool). readingXXX parameters specify corpus and starting point, control font size (usually via letter-to-letter spacing in deg), number of characters per line, and number of lines per page, and determine how many alternatives in each retention question and how many retention questions. The set of alternatives consists of a target word and foils that have approximately the same frequency in the corpus. IMPORTANT: conditionTrials is ignored when targetKind==reading. \n• rsvpReading Flashes several words with Quest-controlled word duration. The parameter responseSpokenToExperimenterBool determines whether the trial\'s scoring is "spoken" (for children) or "silent" (for adults). In "silent" scoring, the participant sees a horizontal row of lines, each representing a shown word. Below each line is a list of possible words, including the correct one. The participant must select a word in each column to continue. readingXXX parameters specify how many alternatives for each word and how many retention questions. The set of alternatives consists of a target word and foils that have approximately the same frequency in the corpus.  In "spoken" scoring we assume that an experimenter sits next to the child participant, who reads the presented words aloud. Once the child has read the words aloud, the experimenter presses the SHIFT key to see the actual words, to guide scoring of what the child said. For each word, the experimenter presses either the up arrow for correct or down arrow for wrong. Supports fontLeftToRightBool for, e.g., Arabic.\n• sound A sound is randomly drawn, without replacement (for this condition in this block) from a folder whose name is specified by targetSoundFolder. The target sound is played for its full duration at level targetSoundDBSPL with a masker sound randomly selected from the maskerSoundFolder played at level maskerDBSPL. Also, in the background, we play targetSoundNoise at level targetSoundNoiseDBSPL.\n• vocoderPhrase. The targetSoundFolder and maskerSoundFolder each contain a hierarchy of folders containing 16-channel sound files. Each sound file is named for a word and contains the original or processed sound of that word (except that the file called "GoTo.wav" in fact contains the two words "go to"). The top level of folders in targetSoundFolder and maskerSoundFolder are folders of sounds produced by several talkers. Currently the talkers (Talker11, Talker14, Talker16, and Talker18) are all female. On each trial the target and masker are randomly assigned different talkers (never equal). Within each talker\'s folder are several loose word files (Now.wav, GoTo.wav, and Ready.wav), and several category folders (CallSign, Color, Number) that each contain several word files. Each trial follows text phrases provided in the parameters targetSoundPhrase and maskerSoundPhrase. Each phrase consists of a series of explicit words and category names, with each category name preceded by #. Currently the targetSoundPhrase is "Ready Baron GoTo #Color #Number Now", and the maskerSoundPhrase is "Ready #CallSign GoTo #Color #Number Now". The target and masker phrases are played at the same time, aligning the temporal midpoint of both words in each target-masker pair by symmetrically padding both ends of the briefer word with zeroes to make it the same length as the longer word. Each explicit word in each script is played every time. On each trial, each word category, marked by #, is replaced by a randomly selected word from that category folder, except that target and masker are always different from each other when either is drawn from a category.  On each trial, the target and masker phrases are combined by randomly taking targetSoundChannels (default 9) of the 16 channels of every word in the target phrase, and the remaining 16-targetSoundChannels channels from the masker words. The channel selection is consistent for all the words in the phrase, and new for each trial. targetSoundDBSPL specifies the sound level of the combined targetSoundChannels channels taken from each target word. Similarly maskerSoundDBSPL specifies the sound level of the combined 16-targetSoundChannels channels taken from each masker word. Also, we play targetSoundNoise at level targetSoundNoiseDBSPL. The Zhang et al. (2021) paper mentions a noise control, in which the masker is white noise that has been filtered into 16 bands and windowed into word-length durations. The scientist achieves this simply by providing a maskerSoundFolder made up of these 16-channel noises, each derived from a word. \nRESPONSE. After playing the phrase, EasyEyes displays two columns, one for each category word in the targetSoundPhrase. The observer must select one word in each column in order to proceed to the next trial. (This is forced choice.) We score the trial as right only if both responses are right. That overall right/wrong response is provided to QUEST, which controls the targetSoundDBSPL.⭑ ',

The stimulus and its memory are protected by disabling nudging from the moment of the participant's request for a new trial until the observer responds. \n\nFor now, the trial software sets the internal parameter nudgingAllowedBool to TRUE only during the pre-trial, and sets nudgingCancelsTrialBool to always be FALSE.  The scientist has no control over nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool.\n\nIf we acquire the possibility of canceling a trial, then we could allow nudging during the stimulus interval, and immediately cancel that trial. Once a trial has been canceled we do NOT wait for a response. Instead, we proceed directly to draw the crosshair for the next trial. Canceling a trial is not trivial. We need to put this trial's condition back into the list of conditions to be run, and that list needs to be reshuffled, so the participant won't know what the next trial will be. I suppose that what happened will be obvious to the participant, so we don't need to explain that the trial was canceled. I see two stages of implementation. First the trial software needs to provide and update two flags: nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool. The current version of MultistairHandler doesn't cope with trial cancelation. For now, the trial software sets nudgingAllowedBool to TRUE only during the pre-trial interval, and sets nudgingCancelsTrialBool to always be FALSE. Once we know how to cancel a trial, during the stimulus interval we'll set both nudgingAllowedBool and nudgingCancelsTrialBool to TRUE. \n",
