instructionForBlock,,"Each trial will present flickering stripes. Your job is to report the stripe orientation: horizontal, vertical, tilted left or tilted right. When you're right, you'll hear a beep. Click Proceed to continue."
instructionForResponse,,"What was the orientation of the stripes? Click or type H for horizontal, V for vertical, L for tilted left or R for tilted right."
instructionForStimulus,,"When you're ready, track center of the moving crosshair with your mouse pointer."
